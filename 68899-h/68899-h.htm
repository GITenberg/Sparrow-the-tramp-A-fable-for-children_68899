<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“L</span>et</span> that sugar-bowl alone, Posy,”
said Tom, as Posy extracted a
lump while they were waiting for Papa
and Mamma to come down to breakfast.</p>

<p>“I’m not taking it for <i>myself</i>,” answered
Posy, as plainly as the large lump in her
mouth permitted her to speak; “I’m only
just getting a lump for Dicky.”</p>

<p>“That’s a story,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I was only just tasting it to see if it
was a real sweet lump,” said Posy very
distinctly now, for the lump had disappeared.
“I didn’t mean to eat it, but it
went all to pieces in my mouth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“You might have known it would,” said
Tom.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better pick out a real hard
lump next time,” said Posy; and she made
up her mind not to put that one in her
mouth, so she only lapped it a little as she
walked towards the canary’s cage.</p>

<p>Just then a noise was heard from the
china-closet, and Tom at once went to see
what it was.</p>

<p>“Why, there’s a mouse-hole right in
the corner of that upper shelf,” he said;
“I thought it sounded like a mouse gnawing.”</p>

<p>“Rats! rats!” called the parrot, whose
cage hung in the window by the side of the
canary’s.</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken, ma’am,” said Tom;
“the barn-cat doesn’t give the rats a
chance to come into the house,&mdash;they live
in the barn.”</p>

<p>“Rats!” again cried the parrot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Posy went up to the parrot’s cage and
looked in.</p>

<p>“How do you do? How’s your mother?”
asked the parrot, with her head on one
side.</p>

<p>“Pretty well, I thank you, Mrs. Polly,”
answered Posy; and she couldn’t resist the
temptation of trying to seize the red feathers
in Mrs. Polly’s tail and give them a
little tweak. Mrs. Polly always resented
such liberties, and made sudden dives at
the chubby fingers; but Posy had learned
to be careful, and drew them out in time.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t really bite Posy, would
you?” asked the canary.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Polly, “I wouldn’t; but
I guess you wouldn’t like to have your
tail pulled every time she gets a chance.
It doesn’t hurt, you know, but it’s very
disagreeable. She steals the peanuts out of
my cage, too, and eats them. She’s a very
mischievous child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“But she’s kind and good,” answered
the canary.</p>

<p>Although this conversation took place between
the birds, to the children it seemed
as if the canary sang his usual song and
Polly chattered in her accustomed way.</p>

<p>Just then Mr. and Mrs. Winton appeared,
and the family took their places at the
breakfast-table.</p>

<p>Soon a slight rattling was heard among
the dishes in the china-closet, and Mr. Winton
cautiously approached the closet door
and suddenly opened it. A large rat
whisked into the hole Tom had discovered.</p>

<p>“We never had a rat in the house before,”
said Mr. Winton, as he returned to his
seat; “I am afraid the house-cat doesn’t
do her duty. I never thought her so good
a ratter as the barn-cat.”</p>

<p>“Michael must stop up the hole at once
with broken glass and mortar,” said Mrs.
Winton; “I can’t have rats in the house.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>“Posy, run into the kitchen and see if
Hannah has any more muffins,” said Papa;
for Katie, who had been both waitress and
nurse to Posy, had been gone a few days,
and her place had not been supplied.</p>

<p>“How long that child stays!” said Papa,
when some minutes had elapsed and she
did not return.</p>

<p>“Hannah is rather slow,” answered Mamma,
“and perhaps the muffins were not
quite ready.”</p>

<p>A few minutes more passed, but no Posy
appeared.</p>

<p>“What can that thumping be?” said
Mamma. “I can’t imagine what Hannah
can be doing. I have heard it for some
time. Do run and see what it means,
Tom.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if Posy were up
to some mischief,” said Tom, as he disappeared.</p>

<p>“What in the world can that boy be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>doing?” exclaimed Papa, after they had
waited some time and neither of the children
appeared.</p>

<p>“I will see what the trouble is,” said
Mamma; but before she rose from her seat
Tom reappeared, laughing, and leading
Posy, who appeared somewhat confused as
she resumed her seat in silence.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose Posy has been
doing?” said Tom. “She found Hannah
down cellar getting coal, and she locked
her down; and then she took the house-kittens
and dipped their heads in the pitcher
of milk on the table and made ’em drink,
and then she brought in the barn-kittens
and made them drink too. Hannah said
Posy made believe she didn’t hear when
Hannah pounded on the door and told
Posy to let her out. She said she heard
Posy running backward and forward, hurrying
to get through before anybody
came.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Posy, “kittens have to be
teached to drink milk, you know.”</p>

<p>Papa laughed, as he was very apt to do
when he heard of Posy’s mischief; but
when Mamma shook her head at him he
stopped and tried to look very serious.</p>

<p>“It was very naughty of you to lock
Hannah down cellar, Posy,” he said; “you
see I can’t have any more muffins, for it’s
time for me to go for the train.”</p>

<p>Posy looked very sad to think she had
been the cause of so much trouble, and
Papa could never bear to see his little girl
unhappy; so he caught her in his arms and
kissed her, saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>“But I can’t help loving you, if you <i>are</i>
naughty.”</p>

<p>“Hannah,” said Posy, as Hannah entered
to take away the breakfast, “my
papa says it was very naughty in me to
lock you down cellar, but that he loves
me still.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Michael,” said Mr. Winton, as the horse
was brought around to the door to take
him to the depot, “the rats gnawed a hole
through the wall in the china-closet last
night, and I want you to stop it up with
mortar and broken glass.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” answered Michael. “If
the barn-cat could be in two places to onst,
it’s no rats ye’d have in the house. She’s
a rale knowing baste, is the barn-cat. If
you could only see the sinsible way she
has wid them kittens of hers. She kapes
thim out of doors in foine weather; and
when the jew begins to fall, if it’s shut the
door is, she kapes thim walking about, for
fear it’s a cold they’ll get.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and see them,” said Tom; and
off ran the children as Mr. Winton stepped
into the carriage and drove off.</p>

<p>Then, when all was still in the dining-room,
a slight noise might have been heard
in the china-closet, and a long nose and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>pair of very sharp black eyes appeared in
the now rat-hole.</p>

<p>Looking cautiously around, and stopping
every minute to listen, the rat ventured out.
He was quite gray about the mouth from
age, and had a particularly vicious look in
his shrewd old eyes. Finding all still, he
ventured out a little farther, and still farther,
and at last slid down from the shelf
and  entered the dining-room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly’s quick ears had heard him,
and she watched him as he noiselessly
moved about, picking up the crumbs that
had fallen from the table.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” called out Mrs. Polly.</p>

<p>“Speak a little louder while you’re about
it,” snarled the old rat, who had started at
the sound of her voice and listened anxiously
to hear if there were danger of detection;
and as he spoke he gave a very vicious
grin that displayed his long yellow teeth,
with one of the front ones broken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“I haven’t time to sit for my portrait
this morning,” resumed the old rat, as Mrs.
Polly continued to gaze steadfastly at him.
“You’ll know me the next time you see
me, I hope!”</p>

<p>“I know you already,” said Mrs. Polly;
“you’re Graywhisker.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” exclaimed the old rat, with
another grin that showed the broken front
tooth; “there’s nothing like being famous.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard of you from my friend the
barn-cat,” said Mrs. Polly. “She has known
you a long time, she says, but you don’t
care to become very intimate with her;”
and Mrs. Polly gave a short laugh that
was very irritating to Graywhisker’s
nerves.</p>

<p>“The old fiend!” he exclaimed angrily;
“of all the meddlesome old&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Don’t get excited,” said Mrs. Polly
calmly.</p>

<p>“You’d better mind your own business,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>answered the old rat, “or you’ll find yourself
in trouble. The barn-cat and you are
two very different individuals, and I shan’t
stand on ceremony with you, I can assure
you.”</p>

<p>“Do stand on ceremony with me,” said
Mrs. Polly, with another laugh.</p>

<p>Graywhisker brought his teeth savagely
together; but Mrs. Polly kept her cold gray
eye on him in such a very unconcerned
manner that he evidently thought better of
his intention and resumed his search for
food.</p>

<p>“Mean people these,” he muttered; “not
a scrap left. Come, don’t be stingy, Mrs.
Polly; give me one of your peanuts there.
I don’t know when I’ve tasted a peanut,&mdash;not
since the day Posy left a few and went
into the house for a glass of water. She
didn’t find many left when she came back,
though.”</p>

<p>“Come and get one if you want it,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>Mrs. Polly, eying five freshly roasted peanuts
that lay on the bottom of her cage.</p>

<p>Graywhisker watched her shrewdly for
an instant, but couldn’t determine from
her expressionless countenance whether she
really meant what she said.</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to pick one out,” he
said to himself as he began to climb the
drapery that hung by the parrot’s cage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly watched him as he nimbly
pulled himself up, and sat with her head
inclined slightly forward, following every
motion of his. When opposite the cage, he
seized it with one of his forepaws, and with
the other tried to fish out a particularly fat
peanut; but before he could draw it out
Mrs. Polly’s sharp beak pounced down on
the paw, and he gave a squeal of pain.</p>

<p>“Did it taste as well as those you stole
from Posy?” asked Mrs. Polly.</p>

<p>“You old vixen!” began Graywhisker,
“you&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t swear,” said Mrs. Polly coolly.</p>

<p>The canary had been a silent spectator
all this time, and hardly dared to breathe;
but when Mrs. Polly pounced on the old
rat’s paw she gave a nervous flutter.</p>

<p>“Oh! I hadn’t noticed you before, my
friend,” exclaimed Graywhisker, with his
horrible grin; “you’re a very tender morsel,
and I’m not a bit afraid of your soft
little beak;” and the old villain began to
descend the curtain on Mrs. Polly’s side and
ascend the one that hung by the canary’s
cage.</p>

<p>Poor Dicky was completely paralyzed
with terror. Up came the gray nose and
wicked-looking eyes nearer and nearer, and
yet poor Dicky sat without stirring, his
terrified eyes fastened on the horrible monster
that could crush him with one grasp of
his paw. At last he was opposite the cage,
and was about to reach out his paw to
seize it, when the spell that kept Dicky
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>silent seemed broken, and he fluttered about,
uttering cries of terror. The strong paw still
held the cage, and the other paw reached in
between the wires; but as the frightened
bird, in his agitation, fluttered within reach
of the relentless paw, Mrs. Polly gave a
shrill whistle, and then another louder still.</p>

<p>A rustling was heard in the bushes outside
the window, and at the sound Graywhisker
descended the curtain and scurried into the
closet, disappearing into his hole as the
house-cat, with gleaming eyes, jumped on
the window-sill and glared around.</p>

<p>“Which way did he go?” she demanded.</p>

<p>The gray nose was pushed cautiously out
of the hole, and a voice said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Mrs. House-cat, did you ever get left?”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> Posy caught up the kittens to
carry them back to their nest in the
barn, it was no wonder that the barn-cat
followed her with a distressed and anxious
countenance. Posy had been in such a
hurry that she had taken one of the barn-kittens
and one of the house-kittens!</p>

<p>The barn-cat tried very hard to make the
little girl understand her mistake, and ran
about her with her tail in the air and crying
dismally; but Posy didn’t understand, and
ran back to the house after putting the kittens
in their nest. How the barn-cat did
wish she could speak! She looked at the
kitten that belonged to the house-cat. It
was very pretty,&mdash;maltese, with a little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>white on the breast and about the nose,
very like its mother.</p>

<p>“It’s rather a good-looking kitten, there’s
no doubt about that,” said the barn-cat,
“but to my mind not <i>half</i> so pretty and
cunning as my little tiger-kitten that Posy
left in the kitchen. That house-cat doesn’t
know how to bring up a family; she’ll spoil
this one just as she has all of her others.
It’ll grow up as vain and indolent as she
is herself. I’m sure I don’t want it here.
Come,” she said, poking the kitten with
her paw, “you just run home again, will
you?”</p>

<p>The house-kitten didn’t seem to understand
what the barn-cat said, for she evidently
thought the cat wanted to play with
her, and she tried to catch the big paw in
both of her little ones.</p>

<p>“Well, you <i>are</i> cunning,” said the barn-cat.
“It’s too bad to have you grow up a
spoilt child. You’ll never be as smart as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>my kittens, of course, but I’ve a great mind
to keep you and see what you’ll make if
you are properly brought up.”</p>

<p>She didn’t like to show the kitten that
she was watching her, for it might make her
vain; so she pretended to be looking very
intently at something out in the yard and
gently moved the tip of her tail, but she
looked out of the corners of her eyes and
saw the little house-kitten at once try to
catch it.</p>

<p>“Pretty well,” she said to herself, “considering
you’ve never had any instruction.
When you’re a little older I’ll teach you
how to crouch and spring, the way I do my
own kittens.”</p>

<p>Now that the barn-cat had decided to
keep the house-kitten, she set about washing
it; for Posy had dipped its head so far into
the milk-pitcher that it presented a very
untidy appearance.</p>

<p>She washed it in a most thorough manner;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
but the barn-cat was not so gentle in
her ways as the house-cat, and the little
house-kitten thought her pretty rough.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t be a baby and cry for
nothing,” said the barn-cat, when the kitten
gave a mew as the rough tongue lifted her
off her feet; “I see you’ve been coddled
too much already.”</p>

<p>Just then a plaintive cry was heard from
the kitchen, and with one leap the barn-cat
was out of her nest and running up to the
kitchen door. She didn’t dare go in; for
there was Hannah, and she knew by experience
that she would be driven out if she
attempted to enter. What <i>was</i> to be done?</p>

<p>The barn-cat jumped on the window-sill
and looked in. There was her darling
in the box by the stove and crying helplessly
for her. The mother cat gave a low
mew, which the baby kitten heard and understood
just as a human baby understands
when its mother speaks soothingly to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“Oh dear!” exclaimed the barn-cat, “if
I could only get into that kitchen! I know
what I’ll do. I’ll tell Mrs. Polly about
it, and see what she advises; she’s very
wise.”</p>

<p>So the barn-cat jumped down from the
kitchen window and on the sill of the
dining-room window, which stood open.
Posy was in the room, and so was Mrs.
Winton; but they couldn’t understand the
language animals converse in.</p>

<p>“Why, there is the barn-cat,” cried Posy,
“right on the window-seat!”</p>

<p>“Don’t frighten her away, but watch her
quietly,” said Mamma; “I like to have her
come about the house;” and Posy was very
careful not to make any noise.</p>

<p>“I do believe that barn-cat is telling
Polly something, Mamma,” said Posy in a
low tone; “her keeps mewing, and Polly
looks just as if her was listening.”</p>

<p>“Polly is certainly very talkative this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>morning,” answered Mamma; “it really does
seem as if they were talking together.”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what they were saying,”
said Posy.</p>

<p>This is what they said:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’m in trouble, Mrs. Polly,” began the
barn-cat, “and I want you to help me out
of it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered Polly, with her very
wisest expression, “what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Then the barn-cat told about Posy’s mistake,
and how anxious it made her to have
her kitten away from her.</p>

<p>“It’s just like Posy,” answered Polly;
“she’s a very mischievous child. She always
tweaks my tail whenever she gets a
chance.”</p>

<p>“But she’s a dear, loving child,” said the
barn-cat warmly. “How she did cry when
they gave away my last kittens!”</p>

<p>“Yes, she’s a good little thing,” said
Polly. “If ’twas anybody else that pulled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>my tail, I’d give ’em such a nip that they
wouldn’t try it again in a hurry; but nobody
could hurt Posy. She does fish some
of my peanuts out of my cage and eat ’em
up sometimes, but then she doesn’t mean
any harm.”</p>

<p>“What I want to know is whether you
can think of any way for me to get my
kitten back,” said the barn-cat. “I tried
to make Posy understand what a dreadful
mistake she’d made, but she was in such a
hurry she didn’t see it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly put her head on one side in a
very knowing and contemplative manner.
After a few moments’ reflection she said,
“The thing to do is to get Hannah out of
the kitchen for a while.”</p>

<p>“That’s very evident,” said the canary,
who had been listening attentively and
didn’t like to be left out of the conversation.</p>

<p>“If it’s so very evident,” said Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 29]</span>Polly, bristling up, “why don’t you do
it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say <i>I</i> could do it; but if I
could talk as you can, I would,” answered
the canary good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“How would you do it, pray?” asked
Mrs. Polly in an irritable tone.</p>

<p>“Why, I’d call Hannah the way Mrs.
Winton does. I heard you call her the
other day, and I declare I wouldn’t have
believed it wasn’t she. I never knew a
bird that could talk as plainly as you do.”</p>

<p>The canary was so good-natured that
Mrs. Polly was rather ashamed of her ill-temper,
and gave a sneeze and cough to
hide her embarrassment.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said, after a pause, “perhaps
that’s as good a way as any other. I <i>did</i>
think of yelling to make her think I’d got
my head caught between the wires, but
Posy doesn’t like to hear such a noise.
You go ’round to the kitchen door,” she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>said to the barn-cat; “and when Hannah
leaves the kitchen you just dart in, seize
your kitten, and run off with it.”</p>

<p>The barn-cat hardly waited to hear the
last words, and ran around to the kitchen
door. She had hardly arrived there when
she heard Polly call “Hannah!” so exactly
like Mrs. Winton that Hannah dropped the
broom with which she was sweeping the
floor, and answering, “Yes, ma’am,” hurried
into the dining-room.</p>

<p>In darted the barn-cat, caught up her
darling in her mouth, and had it back in
her own nest in the barn before Hannah
had discovered how Polly had “fooled”
her, as she called it.</p>

<p>But when the house-cat came home from
her visit, imagine what was her surprise
and grief to find one of her babies gone!</p>

<p>“That barn-cat!” she exclaimed, “I believe
she has stolen it because it’s so much
prettier than her common-looking babies.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>She was always as jealous as she could be
of them!” and out to the barn went the
house-cat.</p>

<p>“I never visited her before,” she said to
herself, “she’s so countrified in her ways
and lives in a barn; but I must see if she’s
got my baby.”</p>

<p>The barn-cat knew what she was coming
for as soon as she caught sight of her.</p>

<p>“I want my kitten,” said the house-cat,
going up to the box; and she stepped very
daintily and held her head very high, as if
she were afraid of soiling her shining fur.
“I should think you’d be ashamed of yourself
to slink into the house and steal my
kitten! But I don’t suppose you know any
better, as you’ve never been used to good
society.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t steal your kitten! I don’t want
your old kitten; it isn’t half so smart or
pretty as mine are.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” answered the house-cat with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>a toss of her head. “Your common-looking
tiger-kittens! Look at my baby’s soft
skin and her gentle little ways!”</p>

<p>“I’ll leave it to Posy if mine are not
the smartest and handsomest,” answered the
barn-cat angrily. “They had hard work
to get anybody to take your kittens the last
time, and mine were spoken for before they
had their eyes open!”</p>

<p>The house-cat was very angry, but she
knew there was truth in what the barn-cat
said; so she only repeated, “Indeed!” in
a very scornful manner, and tossed her
head.</p>

<p>“You coddle your children too much,”
continued the barn-cat. “You keep them
by the warm stove, and don’t take them
out doors often enough. That makes them
tender.”</p>

<p>“When I want your advice I’ll ask for
it,” answered the house-cat loftily, as she
took up her kitten and went home with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>“It was a pretty enough kitten, though I
wasn’t going to tell her so,” said the barn-cat
to herself. “I think I could have made
a smart kitten of it, but it will only be
spoiled now;” and the barn-cat sighed as
she lapped a rough spot on one of her
kitten’s ears.</p>

<p class="p2b">“Meaw! meaw!” was heard in plaintive
tones just outside the barn-door. It was a
new voice, and the barn-cat quickly sprang
up to see what was the matter. On the step
of the barn-door sat a little gray kitten with
a rough and muddy fur, who looked as if
she had travelled a long way. She kept
uttering sad little mews; and as she turned
her head towards the barn-cat the latter saw
that she was blind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“W</span>ell</span>, where did you come from, I
should like to know?” asked the
barn-cat sharply; for the little gray kitten
didn’t present a very respectable appearance,
and she was very particular about the
company her family kept.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ve come a long, long way,” said
the gray kitten in a sad little voice, “all
the way from the other side of the town,
and I am very tired.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you stay at home?” said
the barn-cat. “Home’s the best place for
young people.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any home,” sighed the
gray kitten.</p>

<p>“That’s a likely story,” said the barn-cat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
shortly. “Where’s your mother? She
must be a nice kind of a mother not to provide
a home for her children. Every cat
can do that.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any mother,” said the
little gray kitten sadly.</p>

<p>The barn-cat gave her nose a sharp rub
with her paw,&mdash;a habit she had when her
feelings were touched.</p>

<p>“Well, you live somewhere, I suppose.
Who gives you food? You can’t live on
air.”</p>

<p>“Last night I slept in a hollow tree,”
said the gray kitten, “and I assure you I
don’t get much to eat. If it hadn’t been
for a little girl sharing her food with me, I
should have starved long ago, for I am
’most blind and can’t see well enough to
make my own living.”</p>

<p>“I should like to hear your story,” said
the barn-cat, “and then we’ll see what can
be done for you. Let me see&mdash;” and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>she rubbed her ear in a contemplative way.
“I think we’d better let Mrs. Polly and
the canary hear your story, too. They are
both pretty wise, and three heads are better
than one any day. There comes that house-cat;
she’s nobody.”</p>

<p>So the barn-cat led the way to the open
window where the parrot’s and canary’s
cages were hanging.</p>

<p>“What under the sun have you got
there?” asked Mrs. Polly, eying the poor
little gray kitten shrewdly.</p>

<p>The barn-cat had jumped on the window-seat,
but the gray kitten had modestly
seated herself on the ground under the window.
The house-cat, too, had joined the
group, and placed herself where she could
watch the little gray kitten. She stared
at the poor little thing so scornfully that
she didn’t know which way to look; so
she looked on the ground and presented a
very miserable appearance indeed, with her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>soiled and rumpled fur and her poor half-blind
eyes.</p>

<p>“Where did you pick her up?” asked
Mrs. Polly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know much more about her than
you do,” answered the barn-cat. “I found
her a few minutes ago on the door-step of
the barn, and she tells me she has come
from the other side of the town, and that
she hasn’t any mother. I thought you’d
better see her and hear her story, and perhaps
you’d think of something that could
be done for her.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly put on her wise look and gave
a little Ahem! for it always gratified her to
be looked up to and asked for advice.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the house-cat sat staring the
poor gray kitten out of countenance. “<i>My</i>
advice is to send her back where she came
from,” she said. “Anybody can see that
she’s only a tramp. I won’t have <i>my</i>
children taught any of her common ways.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>Besides, there are too many cats around
already,” she added, eying the barn-cat
so scornfully that it was very evident she
referred to her and her kittens.</p>

<p>“Whoever she is and wherever she comes
from, it’s as plain as the nose on your face
that she’s been well brought up,” answered
the barn-cat quickly. “She’s quiet and
lady-like in her manners, and that’s more
than can be said of some who’ve had the
best of advantages.”</p>

<p>“She’s a common kitten, probably
brought up in a barn,” said the house-cat
contemptuously, “and has no style whatever.”</p>

<p>This was too much for the barn-cat’s endurance,
and she gave an angry spit, when
the canary, who was always the peace-maker,
interposed.</p>

<p>“Whatever she may be,” said the canary
gently, “she’s neglected and unfortunate;
so, if Mrs. Polly will find out her story, I’m
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>sure she will find a way to help her out of
her troubles. If her wise head can’t, I don’t
know whose can.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Polly, “I should have
done so long ago if our friends here hadn’t
taken up so much time in disputing. Now,
little gray kitten, tell us all you know
about yourself,&mdash;where you were born, and
how it happens that you are left alone in
this big world to take care of yourself.”</p>

<p>“I can’t remember very much about myself,”
began the little gray kitten in a plaintive
voice, “but I know we were always
poor. My mother worked very hard to
support us, for the woman who kept us was
very mean and never gave us anything to
eat. I have heard my mother say she was
the meanest woman she ever knew. She
said she had heard her say that she kept a
cat to get rid of the rats and mice, and that
she expected her to earn her own living.”</p>

<p>“Well,” interrupted the barn-cat, “that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>is all very well for a single cat; but when a
cat has a young family it comes pretty hard
to keep them supplied with food. I never
let my children eat mice; it doesn’t agree
with them,&mdash;gives ’em the stomach-ache
and makes ’em fitty.”</p>

<p>“It’s no harm to give ’em a mouse to
play with,” said the house-cat; “I often do
mine.”</p>

<p>“When you catch one, which isn’t often,”
said the barn-cat in an undertone.</p>

<p>“What was that you said?” asked the
house-cat sharply; “be kind enough to say
it a little louder.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, come,” put in the canary,
“do let the gray kitten go on with her
story. You were telling us that your
mother had to catch all the food for you.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued the little gray kitten,
“so she did. She often brought us mice,
and sometimes a bird,&mdash;birds agreed best
with us, she said.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Dear me!” exclaimed the canary with
a shudder, “what a very bloodthirsty cat
your mother must have been!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me, I didn’t mean to hurt your
feelings,” said the little gray kitten, so politely
that Mrs. Polly said to herself with
a little nod of satisfaction,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Very well brought up, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Go on, my dear, with your story,” said
Mrs. Polly, aloud. “How many were there
of you?”</p>

<p>“There were only my brother and myself,”
answered the little gray kitten. “My
mother said there were two others, but they
died very young,&mdash;before they had their
eyes open. She said she thought they
didn’t have enough to eat.”</p>

<p>“Well, how about your mother? I’m
anxious to hear about her,” said the barn-cat.</p>

<p>“It makes me very sad to think about
it,” continued the little gray kitten, almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>crying. “One day my mother told me and
my brother that she was going to teach us
how to hunt. It was the first time we
had been out of doors; we lived in an
old shed. It was a very pleasant day,
and the air was so fresh, and the birds did
look so tempting&mdash; I beg your pardon,”
she added, as the canary began to flutter
nervously.</p>

<p>“Never mind; go on with your story,”
said the canary good-naturedly. “It’s your
nature; you aren’t to blame.”</p>

<p>The little gray kitten was so embarrassed
by this interruption that she forgot where
she had left off in her story; but then she
was so very little!</p>

<p>“You were saying,” said Mrs. Polly,
“that your mother took you out of doors
to teach you to hunt.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” answered the gray kitten, “so
I was. Well, it was very pleasant, and
we enjoyed ourselves very much, and I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>caught a little field-mouse, and so did my
brother; and our mother praised us, and said
that after all perhaps we would turn out
smarter cats than if we had been brought
up to have everything we wanted, for then
we might have become lazy.”</p>

<p>“Very true, indeed,” interrupted the barn-cat,
with a triumphant glance at the house-cat.
“Your mother must have been a very
sensible cat!”</p>

<p>“Well, then what happened, little one?”
asked Mrs. Polly; for the gray kitten was
again thrown off her balance by the interruption.</p>

<p>“The next is very sad, indeed,” said the
gray kitten. “We were going home, so
happy to think our dear mother was so
pleased with us, when all at once we heard
a dreadful noise. My brother and I were
frightened half to death, for we had never
heard a noise like it. My mother said it
was a dog, and there was a boy with it,&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>bad boy; my mother said all boys were
bad&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Not <i>all</i> boys,” said the barn-cat. “Tom
isn’t a bad boy; he wouldn’t hurt a kitten
for the world. I’d trust him anywhere
with my kittens.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t so mischievous as Posy is,”
said the house-cat.</p>

<p>“Posy isn’t mischievous,” said the barn-cat
warmly; “she doesn’t mean to do mischief.
You can’t call it mischief when she
thinks she’s doing something to help you
all the time.”</p>

<p>“Please don’t interrupt so often,” said the
canary; “you said, little kitten, that a big
dog and a boy came up.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued the little gray kitten;
“and as soon as the boy saw us he said,
‘Hie, Rover, seize ’em, sir!’ and the big
dog, looking, oh, so fierce and angry,
rushed at us with his mouth wide open,
and making that dreadful noise. There was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>a tree near us, and my mother told my
brother and me to climb up the tree as
quickly as we could. My poor mother
gave us the first chance, for she knew we
couldn’t climb as well as she could, and she
stood at the foot of the tree with her fur all
bristling up and spitting at the big dog. We
got up to the first branches where the dog
couldn’t reach us; but before my poor mother
had time to follow us the big dog seized
her, and gave her one shake and killed her.”</p>

<p>Her hearers were very quiet as the little
gray kitten ceased and sat crying softly
to herself. The barn-cat gave her nose a
sharp rub with her paw, and then jumped
down and examined very carefully a hole
under the window, as if she expected to
find a mouse there. Her feelings were
very much touched, for she couldn’t help
thinking how dreadful it would be if her
little kittens were left without a mother to
care for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” she said, after a pause, coming
back to her place on the window-sill,
“what did your brother and you do
then?”</p>

<p>“We waited till the boy and the big dog
were gone,” said the little gray kitten, “and
then we climbed down from the tree and
went home. It was very lonely in the old
shed, and we almost starved to death, for
we were too small to catch mice enough to
satisfy our appetites. My brother got tired
of living so, and said he was going to try
to find a better home where they would
feed him, but I stayed where I was.”</p>

<p>“How about that girl you said used to
feed you?” asked the house-cat.</p>

<p>“She was a poor little girl who didn’t
have any mother either, and the woman I
belonged to made her work hard and gave
her very little to eat; but she pitied me,
and often went hungry herself to share her
food with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>“What made your eyes so bad, my
dear?” asked Mrs. Polly kindly.</p>

<p>“I think it must have been the cold; it
was very cold in the shed.”</p>

<p>There was a few minutes’ silence, and
then Mrs. Polly said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have been thinking the matter over,
and I believe the best thing to do is to get
Posy to help us. You put yourself in the
way where she’ll see you,” she said to the
little gray kitten, “and all will be well.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">P</span>osy</span> and Tom were seated on the
kitchen door-step, and the two house-kittens
lay in Posy’s lap. Posy was in a
very thoughtful mood, and sat watching the
kittens in silence.</p>

<p>“I’ve been wondering, Tom,” she said
at last, “where God keeps his babies that
haven’t got any wings.”</p>

<p>“Why, babies don’t ever have wings,
Posy,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I should think,” said Posy thoughtfully,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>“that we might see Him when he goes
around from house to house.”</p>

<p>“Why, of course we can’t,” answered
Tom decidedly.</p>

<p>Posy played with the kittens in her
lap.</p>

<p>“Come, Kitty, and have your bonnet on,”
she said, folding her handkerchief over the
head of one of the kittens and tying it
under her chin. “Poor thing, you haven’t
got a single dress after your name, and I
must make you one. And I guess I’d better
make some little cow-catchers around
your forehead; they are very becoming to
your little rosy face.”</p>

<p>“Cow-catchers!” laughed Tom. “You
mean beau-catchers! What a little goosie
you are, Posy!”</p>

<p>“I know that just as well as you can,”
answered Posy, blushing; and she thought
it best to turn the conversation.</p>

<p>“Tom,” she said, “I guess I shall marry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>you when I’m grown up,&mdash;either you or
Papa.”</p>

<p>“People can’t marry their fathers!” said
Tom, with an air of superior wisdom, “because
they’ve got married already, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, I shall marry you, because
I love you so much. People can marry
their brothers, can’t they, Tom?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” answered
Tom shrewdly.</p>

<p>“Well, then, let me see&mdash;who shall I
marry? I <i>did</i> think of marrying Mary
Weston, but her’s married already, you
know. I guess I’ll marry Mr. Dawson.”</p>

<p>“I know why,” said Tom quickly; “it’s
because he’s got some puppies! Oh, you
selfish girl!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” said poor Posy in a very
crestfallen manner; “I’d give you one of
the puppies, Tom.”</p>

<p>“I guess Mr. Dawson will be out of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>world long before you’re ready to git married,
Posy,” said Hannah, who had been
listening to the conversation between the
children; “he must be nigh onto seventy if
he’s a day. Well, Tom, who do you intend
to marry?”</p>

<p>“If I marry for love,” answered Tom,
“I shall marry Auntie; but if I marry for
money, I shall marry Katie Thomas, because
her father’s got more money than
old Mr. Thornton, and he’s got a hundred
dollars in the bank.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never!” said Hannah; “but I
guess I’d better be about my work. I wish
that lazy Michael would bring me in some
wood. He grows worse every day. I bet
he’s asleep somewhere,&mdash;he usually <i>is</i>
asleep when there’s anything to be done.”</p>

<p>“He’s gone to get Major shod,” said
Tom; “I saw him go down the yard with
him.”</p>

<p>“There he comes!” said Posy, as a man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>appeared leading a handsome chestnut horse
up the yard.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Michael,” called Posy
when he was opposite the kitchen door.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, Miss,” answered Michael.</p>

<p>“Have you had a nap to-day, Michael?”
asked Posy in her sweetest way.</p>

<p>“No, Miss,” answered Michael, as he led
the horse into the barn.</p>

<p>“That child does beat anything I ever
see,” said Hannah, laughing, as she went
about her work again.</p>

<p>Suddenly a dreadful noise was heard
from the direction of the dining-room window,&mdash;shrieks
as if somebody were in
great distress.</p>

<p>“Polly’s got her head caught between
the wires,” cried Tom, jumping up and running
around to the window. Posy quickly
dumped the kittens into their nest and followed
him as fast as she could. As soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>as they appeared Polly burst into a loud
laugh.</p>

<p>“The next time I shan’t believe you,
ma’am, you’ve fooled me so many times,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, Tom,” cried Posy, “look, see! see
this poor little gray kitten! Poor thing,
her’s awful thin, and her looks as if her
didn’t have any home.”</p>

<p>“Why, she’s blind!” said Tom. “Poor
kitty, come, I won’t hurt you;” and he
lifted the little gray kitten very gently,
and sat down on the piazza step softly
stroking it.</p>

<p>“Her isn’t one bit afraid of us,” said
Posy, seating herself beside Tom and
stroking the kitten too. “Her knows we
won’t hurt her, don’t her, Tom?”</p>

<p>The little gray kitten had heard all about
the children, and felt perfectly secure with
them.</p>

<p>“Her’s purring!” cried Posy joyfully.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>“I mean to ask Mamma if I can keep
her.” And off ran Posy to Mamma’s
room.</p>

<p>“There’s a poor little gray kitten out
doors, Mamma,” said Posy, all out of breath
from hurrying, “and her’s blind of one
eye. Can’t I keep her and take care of
her? Her looks like her didn’t have any
home at all.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mamma, “you may ask Hannah
to give you a saucer of milk for
her.”</p>

<p>“Her’s blind of <i>both</i> eyes,” cried Posy,
bursting into tears; “but I thought you
wouldn’t let me keep her if you knew
it.”</p>

<p>“Why, my dear little girl,” answered
Mamma, drawing Posy to her side, “I love
to have you kind to animals, and particularly
so to those that are helpless and
can’t take care of themselves. Don’t cry,
my darling, you shall give this poor little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>kitten a comfortable home, and make her
as happy as if she were not blind.”</p>

<p>“But it makes me feel bad to think her
can’t see,” said Posy, sobbing.</p>

<p>“Think, my darling, how much more
comfortable you can make her than she has
ever been before; and perhaps it is not so
bad as you think,&mdash;she may not be wholly
blind.”</p>

<p>So Mamma put down her sewing, and
went with Posy to look at the little gray
kitten, who all this time had been purring
away contentedly in Tom’s lap.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Mamma, “she isn’t wholly
blind, she can see out of one eye; and
we will bathe her eyes with some warm
water and a soft sponge, and she will feel
as comfortable as possible.”</p>

<p>“I knew how it would be,” said the parrot
to the canary, as the kitten was carried
off to the kitchen to be fed.</p>

<p>“Kind people, every one of them,” answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
the canary, hopping about for joy.
“Hallo! what’s the barn-cat up to? Do
look at her!”</p>

<p>The barn-cat was creeping cautiously
along the yard, her body almost touching
the ground and her eyes glowing with
eagerness. Sometimes she stopped for an
instant and swished her tail excitedly, then
went on again. The canary and Mrs.
Polly soon saw what it was that excited
her so. A little sparrow sat on a stone
a few rods off, pluming his feathers in a
very unconcerned manner. The barn-cat
stopped and wriggled her body for a final
spring, when all at once Mrs. Polly screamed
out, “Scat! scat!” in so loud a voice and
so exactly like a human being that the
barn-cat stopped in her spring and the sparrow
flew up into a bush opposite the dining-room
window.</p>

<p>Certainly the sparrow was a very rowdy-looking
bird. His feathers were rumpled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>and many of them broken, and he had a
very independent air that was a great contrast
to the refined manner of the well-kept
canary.</p>

<p>“Who are you, pray?” asked Mrs. Polly,
eying the new-comer curiously.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see?” answered the sparrow
in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>“It’s very evident you’re a tramp,” said
Mrs. Polly. “What do you want here?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you’d got a lease of the
place, or I wouldn’t have come,” answered
the sparrow pertly.</p>

<p>“Come now, keep a civil tongue in
your head,” said Mrs. Polly. “You’ll find
it to your advantage. Where do you
live?”</p>

<p>“Wherever I can. Sometimes in one
place, sometimes in another.”</p>

<p>“That looks bad,” said Mrs. Polly gravely.
“Did you ever hear the proverb that ‘rolling
stones gather no moss’?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>“Now look here, Mrs. Parrot, I haven’t
asked anything of you, and I ain’t going to.
I acknowledge I’m a tramp, if having no
home makes a bird one. I get my food
where I can, but I don’t do anybody any
harm. If I prefer to live that way, whose
business is it but my own?”</p>

<p>“You’ve been fighting, I see,” said Mrs.
Polly gravely; “’tisn’t respectable.”</p>

<p>“Now look here, ma’am! You’re kept in
a cage, and have your food given you regular,
and don’t have to trouble yourself about
where your next meal is to come from. I
live where I can, pick up my own meals
where I can find ’em; if I can’t find ’em I
go without. I sleep out in all kinds of
weather, and that makes my feathers rough
and my voice hoarse; but I want you to
understand that I’m just as good a fellow
as if I had a red tail and a hooked
nose.”</p>

<p>“That’s very true,” said the good-natured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
canary, “I should like to make your
acquaintance. You go about so much you
must see and hear a good many things that
we don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I could tell you a thing
or two that would make your feathers curl,”
answered the stranger.</p>

<p>Just then the children came along with
the little gray kitten that had been washed
and fed, and seated themselves on the steps
of the piazza.</p>

<p>“Hallo!” called out the sparrow to the
little gray kitten, “how in the world did
you turn up here?”</p>

<p>“Do you know her?” asked Mrs. Polly.</p>

<p>“Well, I should rather think I did, seeing
as I have lived, as you might say, in the
same family.”</p>

<p>“How is little Nancy?” asked the little
gray kitten. “I have worried a good
deal about that child since I left home.
That’s the little girl I told you was so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>kind to me,” she said in explanation to the
parrot.</p>

<p>“She’s well,” answered the sparrow, “but
I pity the poor thing with all my heart.
This morning she came out and sat on the
door-step, and I saw she was crying, and
she says to me, ‘Billy’ (she always called
me Billy), ‘I can’t give you anything to eat
this morning because I haven’t got anything
myself, and I didn’t get any supper
last night either, Billy, because I couldn’t
sell any matches.’ She didn’t know I sensed
what she was saying, but I did. Look
here! You seem pretty well off around
here. I see the little gray kitten has fallen
into good hands. Can’t you do something
for a poor child that’s half starved and
abused?”</p>

<p>“Oh, do, Mrs. Polly!” said the little gray
kitten. “You were so kind to me, do find
some way to get that poor little Nancy with
these good people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Polly, “I’ll think it
over and see what can be done about it.”</p>

<p>“How loud this gray kitten does purr,”
said Posy. “I guess her’s telling us how
happy her is to get here, don’t you, Tom?”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> next morning Major, the horse, was
eagerly eating his breakfast of nice
fresh oats. He was an easy-tempered fellow,
but this morning he was greatly annoyed,
and with good reason; he was very
hungry and must share his breakfast with
several rats that were bold enough to venture
into his manger and steal his oats from
before his very eyes.</p>

<p>“I do wish my friend the barn-cat would
not take the opportunity to go out while I
am eating,” said Major to himself. “I knew
how it would be when she told me she must
go and see Mrs. Polly about this plan of
bringing that child Nancy here. ‘When
the cat’s away the mice will play;’ and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>what’s more, the rats too. Here, old Graywhisker,
you come any nearer and I’ll bite
off your tail!”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see you do it,” snarled the
old rat; and as he spoke he showed his long
yellow teeth with one of them broken off,
which gave him a very disagreeable expression.
“I’d like to see you stop us from
eating a few of your oats. You’re too fat
already; I heard Mr. Winton tell Michael
so the other day.”</p>

<p>“I should be loath to tell you what I’ve
heard him say about you,” answered Major
angrily; “you wouldn’t sleep very well
nights if I did.”</p>

<p>The old rat forgot his usual caution, and
came nearer to Major’s face than ever before;
and Major, his patience gone, gave a
sudden snort and pushed them all out of the
manger with his nose. Then when he was
left alone he went on eating his breakfast.
After that he found himself becoming very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>sleepy, and shutting his eyes he fell into a
doze. As he slept the old rat stole quietly
out of his hole and looked cautiously about.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said to the others, “come
out on the barn floor, for I have something
of importance to say to you, and this is a
good time, as Major is asleep, and the barn-cat
off. Here, you Silvertail, you keep a
sharp lookout in every direction, and tell
me if you see the barn-cat coming.”</p>

<p>The young rat addressed, quickly climbed
on the window-sill, whence he could command
a fine view of the entrances to the barn.</p>

<p>“Do you see anything of the barn-cat?”
asked the old rat.</p>

<p>“Yes, I see her right in front of the
dining-room window; and by the way she
swishes her tail I know she’s talking pretty
fast.”</p>

<p>“Well, let her swish,” answered the old
rat; “she’ll find there are some people in
the world as smart as she is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>The old rat, Graywhisker, seated himself,
and the other rats came flocking out of
their holes and placed themselves in a circle
about him. Some of them brought their
young families, as they couldn’t trust them
alone.</p>

<p>“I don’t see any of our friends the mice,”
said Graywhisker, looking about with his
sharp old eyes. “Some of you young fellows
run over to Mrs. Silverskin, and tell
her I want to see her at once; and be quick
about it too.”</p>

<p>Two young rats started off, and began to
climb to the hay-mow, playing tag on the
way.</p>

<p>“Here, none of your fooling!” called out
the old rat sharply, as one of them gave a
loud squeak.</p>

<p>This squeak awoke Major from his nap,
and hearing voices his curiosity was aroused.
“I guess I’ll keep my ears open, and perhaps
I shall hear something,” he said to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>himself; “you can’t trust these rats out of
your sight.”</p>

<p>So Major made believe asleep, and even
gave a snore occasionally to mislead the
rats; and he did completely mystify them.</p>

<p>Soon the two young rats returned, scampering
headlong down from the mow, and
followed more leisurely by Mrs. Silverskin,
who had a very timid, gentle air, and who
looked very small and refined by the side
of the great clumsy rats with their bold
countenances.</p>

<p>“Now sit still and listen with all your
ears,” began old Graywhisker, “for I’ve
something of importance to say, and our
time is short, as that arch fiend, the barn-cat,
may return at any moment. To cut a
long matter short, the barn-cat has introduced
another cat here. To be sure, she’s
half blind, and a half-grown kitten, but still
she’s to be dreaded. Then there’s been a
sparrow loafing around here lately, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>they’re laying a plot this very minute to
get a good-for-nothing girl here, but we’ll
put a stop to that. I hid under the piazza
yesterday and heard the whole story,&mdash;how
this girl had fed the lazy sparrow and the
half-blind kitten (it’s good enough for her,
and I wish she was blind of both eyes), and
how they must think of some way to get
this poor child among these good people.
They’re talking it over now, and I’ve
set Sharpears to watch and tell me what
they’ve said. The barn-cat said that if they
could arrange matters so that Posy could
hear her story, she would bring it all about.
Posy, indeed! I hate that child! She makes
a dreadful fuss over all the other animals,
but I heard her say the other day to the
barn-cat, ‘You mustn’t catch the pretty
little birdies, kitty, but you can catch just
as many of the great ugly rats as you’ve a
mind to.’ I paid her off, though; I stole
her piece of cake that she laid down on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>door-step when she went into the house, and
she felt awfully about it. It was real fun
to see how disappointed she was when she
came back and found it gone.”</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Silverskin, who had sat meekly
listening, spoke in a soft little voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Posy could see any
animal suffer. I saw her sprinkle some
crumbs down in front of a hole one day,
and say, ‘These are for the little mice to
eat.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! you take her part, do you?”
said old Graywhisker, fiercely glaring at
the poor little mouse. “If that is your
opinion, you just clear out of my barn. I
want you to understand that I won’t have
any hypocrites around these premises.”</p>

<p>“You can’t call me a hypocrite,” said the
little mouse meekly; “I only said that
Posy was a kind-hearted child. I am sure
I dislike the barn-cat as much as you do,
and it gives me great uneasiness to think
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>there’s another of that species on the premises
if she is half blind. I am afraid our
children will get careless, thinking she can’t
see them, and some day venture too near.
I am sure I shall never have another easy
moment;” and Mrs. Silverskin looked more
anxious than ever.</p>

<p>“Here comes Sharpears creeping along
this way,” called out Silvertail from the
window.</p>

<p>The whole company looked anxiously in
the direction of their private entrance, and
Sharpears soon appeared at the opening.</p>

<p>“Well,” said old Graywhisker impatiently,
“what did you hear?”</p>

<p>“In the first place,” began Sharpears,
“Major has been complaining that we
eat too many of his oats. He says that
when the barn-cat’s away we bother him
so that he can’t take any comfort in his
eating.”</p>

<p>“He eats too much,” said Graywhisker;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>“that’s what’s the matter with him. Just
hear him snore! He’ll go off in a fit of
apoplexy one of these days! I wish he
would!”</p>

<p>“The barn-cat said she did her best; that
she knew the rats and mice did take advantage
of her absence, but that she was going
to train the gray kitten to watch while she
was away.”</p>

<p>“We’ll fix that gray kitten,” snarled the
old rat, bringing his long yellow teeth together
in a very unpleasant manner.</p>

<p>“After that they had a long talk about
how they could bring it about to get that
child Nancy here that had fed the sparrow
and the gray kitten. Feeding the kitten,
indeed! as if there were not cats
enough around already! When I came
away they were talking about having
the sparrow entice her here some way or
other.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you stay and hear it out?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>said the old rat savagely. “I thought you
had more sense.”</p>

<p>“Well, all at once that disagreeable
Polly (she’s always minding everybody’s
business but her own) said, ‘I do believe
there’s a rat under that piazza.’ I didn’t
wait to hear any more, I can tell you, but
slunk off just as the barn-cat jumped down
to find out where the noise came from.”</p>

<p>“Here comes the barn-cat!” called out
Silvertail from the window; and instantly
the whole company darted to their holes,
as the barn-cat appeared at the head of the
stairs.</p>

<p>The barn-cat put her nose up in the air
and sniffed. “Those rats and mice have
been about, sure as you live!” she said.
“I must teach the gray kitten to keep a
sharp lookout while I’m away. Hallo!”
she called to Major, “how are you getting
on?”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Major; “I’ve important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
news for you. I made believe
asleep just now, and heard a thing or
two. The rats know exactly what you’re
plotting, for they set a spy to listen to
your conversation this morning. They
know you’re going to try to get that
girl here, and they’re going to stop it if
they can, because she fed the little gray
kitten.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see ’em do it,” said the
barn-cat.</p>

<p>“They can annoy you, though, in a great
many ways,” said Major; “and, to tell the
truth, I’m afraid they’re going to plot
against the gray kitten. They all seemed
full of spite against her.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to see ’em touch a hair of her
head!” exclaimed the barn-cat ferociously.</p>

<p>“Here comes that dear child, Posy, with
your breakfast,” said Major, as Posy appeared,
carrying a plate and followed by
Tom with a saucer of milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“Here, kitty,” called Posy; “I’ve
brought you some nice milk and some
critters all cut up fine. Are they <i>critters</i>
or fritters?” she asked, turning to Tom.</p>

<p>“<i>Fritters</i>, of course,” answered Tom.
“You do manage to get things twisted
about, Posy. Papa says you are a real
Mrs. Malaprop.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“Kitty,” said Posy, putting her hand in
her pocket and drawing out a little package,
“I have brought you the beautifulest
present you ever had in all your life;” and
Posy began to undo the paper.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">P</span>osy</span> undid the package, and took out a
pretty collar of red leather with a little
padlock hanging from it.</p>

<p>“Come, kitty, and have on your new
collar,” said Posy. “They say you’re not
so handsome as the house-cat, so I must
make you look as well as I can, and you’re
dear if you’re not handsome.”</p>

<p>The barn-cat stood very still while Posy
fitted on the collar and fastened the padlock.</p>

<p>“It’s a little bit loose for you,” said
Posy, “but that is better than to have it
too tight, isn’t it, Tom?”</p>

<p>“See how proud she feels,” said Tom;
“she likes to hear the padlock rattle when
she moves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“It is really a very stylish affair,” said the
barn-cat to herself, “and I must smarten
myself up a little. I wonder what the
house-cat will say now!”</p>

<p>“It’s pretty loose for her,” said Tom;
“I’m afraid she’ll lose it off. Let’s take
it up another notch.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Posy decidedly; “Mamma
said if it was too tight it would make her
uncomf’table.”</p>

<p>“Well, if she loses it, don’t bawl,” answered
Tom.</p>

<p>“I shan’t bawl,” said Posy indignantly.</p>

<p>The children gave a look at the kittens,
and then went away; and the barn-cat ate
her breakfast contentedly, stopping occasionally
to give her head a shake, that she
might have the satisfaction of hearing the
padlock rattle.</p>

<p>That afternoon the barn-cat called the
little gray kitten to her, and told her she
wanted her to keep watch while she went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>to fulfil a very important engagement with
Mrs. Polly and the canary.</p>

<p>“Take good care of the kittens, and don’t
let the rats annoy Major while he is eating.
He complains a good deal of them
lately.”</p>

<p>The little gray kitten promised to do all
she was told; and off hurried the barn-cat,
having carefully washed herself and
smoothed her fur as neatly as she could.</p>

<p>While she was making these preparations,
she did not see a pair of sharp little black
eyes watching all her movements from a
beam above.</p>

<p>“I know what all this means,” said the
owner of the sharp black eyes, “but you
have to get up pretty early to get the start
of an old rat;” and he smiled a very vicious
smile that displayed his long yellow teeth
with one of them broken off.</p>

<p>“I guess I’d better go myself,” continued
old Graywhisker; “these young fellows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>are too giddy to be trusted, and after all
we mustn’t expect to find old heads on
young shoulders;” and he stroked his gray
beard with a very satisfied air.</p>

<p>After the barn-cat had gone, he followed
cautiously at a distance. He knew better
than to trust himself under the piazza again;
so he wedged himself into a space between
the house and a large stone, just around the
corner, where he could hear without being
detected. When he was comfortably settled,
he smiled again to himself to think
how wise he was.</p>

<p>“Well,” he heard Polly say, “here we
are again, except the sparrow,&mdash;he’s late.”</p>

<p>“Just as likely as not we’ll never see
him again,” said the barn-cat. “You can’t
place any reliance on these tramps. I
never did like his looks, I must confess.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he’s a bad fellow at
heart,” said the canary; “he seemed very
anxious to have that little girl taken care of,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>and very grateful for what she did for him.
Bad people are not grateful, you know.”</p>

<p>“I wish he would settle down and become
steady,” said Mrs. Polly, “but I’m
afraid there’s no hope of that. Yesterday
a friend of his flying by stopped and had a
few minutes’ chat with me. He says the
sparrow has a wife and several children,
but that he’s away half the time, and neglects
his family dreadfully, though he’s
good enough to them when he’s at home.
It’s just as I suspected,&mdash;he’s lazy and
shiftless.”</p>

<p>“Well, I confess, that’s just what I
thought of him,” said the barn-cat. “I never
did fancy his looks from the first; but he’s
useful to us, and we must put up with his
failings.”</p>

<p>A slight rustling in a neighboring bush
made them all look in that direction; and
there sat the subject of their conversation,
and judging from the roguish twinkle in his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>eyes, he had evidently heard the whole
conversation.</p>

<p>“Sorry to have kept you waiting,” he
said good-naturedly, “but was detained on
very important business. Hope I see you
as well as usual, ma’am, and that you
haven’t missed me too much,” he said to
the barn-cat with a sly wink.</p>

<p>The barn-cat thought it more dignified
not to answer this familiar speech, and
looked straight before her.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Polly, “let’s make
the most of our time now that we are all
together.”</p>

<p>“First of all,” said the barn-cat, “I want
to tell you that yesterday we were watched.
Old Graywhisker had set a spy to listen
to our conversation, and he reported every
word that was said. However, I’d like to
see him prevent us from carrying out our
plans. I’ll just give a look under the piazza
before we begin; that’s where he was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>yesterday, and the only place where he
could hide.”</p>

<p>Graywhisker kept very still while the
barn-cat investigated the piazza, and hardly
dared breathe; but when she returned to
her place again, saying, “There’s nobody
there now, you may be sure of that,” he
smiled again, and placing his right paw
against his nose waggled it in a very
exultant manner.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Mrs. Polly, “what we have
to do is to decide how we can get the child
Nancy here. I have a plan of my own that
I will mention, and I’d like to have you
express your opinions freely.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the sparrow, who was seated
on a slender branch opposite the window,
was amusing himself by standing first on
one leg and then on the other and having a
fine see-saw all by himself. The barn-cat
watched him eagerly; and his motions were
so graceful, and he was so plump, that she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>quite forgot where she was, and sat swishing
her tail in a very tiger-like manner, and was
about to give a spring when Mrs. Polly’s
keen eyes caught sight of her, and she
called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hallo there! what are you about?”</p>

<p>The barn-cat was really ashamed to have
so forgotten herself, and was greatly embarrassed.</p>

<p>“What can you expect of a cat that’s
been brought up in a barn?” said the
house-cat scornfully. “That comes of letting
such common people associate with
those who have been accustomed to good
society!”</p>

<p>The barn-cat was not ready as usual with
an answer to this taunt from her enemy, for
she knew she had been guilty of very great
rudeness; and Mrs. Polly, knowing that
although her manners were rough her heart
was a very good one, kindly went on with
her remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>“The plan I have thought of is this:
You have all of you seen how often Posy
sits on the piazza and cuts dolls’ dresses out
of bright-colored pieces of ribbon and silk.
Now there is nothing in the world, I have
noticed, that pleases a little girl so much as
those bright colors, and we will take advantage
of that. The next time Posy brings
out her ribbons we must get her out of the
way long enough for one of you to steal the
prettiest one, and then the sparrow can use
it to entice the child Nancy with.”</p>

<p>“But who is to steal the ribbon?” asked
the house-cat.</p>

<p>“I should say the sparrow was the one
to do that,” answered Mrs. Polly; “he can
fly down and pick one out and fly off
with it.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said the sparrow; “but
how are you going to make Posy leave
her ribbons long enough?”</p>

<p>“I’ve called ’em so many times lately,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>said Mrs. Polly, “that they begin to suspect
me; and Tom said the other day that
I had fooled him so many times that he
shouldn’t come again if I called. Let me
see&mdash;” and Mrs. Polly put on her very
wisest expression.</p>

<p>“There’s one way we could fix it,” said
the sparrow. “Here’s my friend the barn-cat;
she’s so fond of me she can’t have me
near enough. Suppose I place myself where
Posy can see me, and the barn-cat can make
believe spring at me just as she did a few
minutes ago. The dear thing! we know she
does it out of affection for me, but Posy
will think she’s in earnest.”</p>

<p>“A very good plan,” said Mrs. Polly.
“Really quite a bright idea,” she said in
an undertone to the canary, “though it
wouldn’t do to tell him so, he’s so well
satisfied with himself.”</p>

<p>The barn-cat had been very quiet since
her attempt to spring at the sparrow, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>she occasionally scratched her neck with
her paw to make that fascinating padlock
rattle. She did it in a very unconscious
manner, but she knew all the time that the
house-cat was watching her out of the corner
of <i>her</i> eye, and was secretly jealous of
the beautiful collar.</p>

<p>“That’s a very pretty collar you have
on,” said the canary.</p>

<p>“A present from Posy,” answered the
barn-cat.</p>

<p>“Very becoming to your complexion.
‘Neat, but not gaudy,’ as the monkey said
when they painted his tail sky-blue,” said
the sparrow gallantly.</p>

<p>“Humph! red and yellow go well together,”
sneered the house-cat. “It brings
out her <i>charming</i> coloring!” and she gave a
taunting laugh.</p>

<p>“Our friend always looks well to me,”
said Mrs. Polly politely.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’re going to be sick,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>said the canary, laughing. “To think of
your paying anybody a compliment!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly was about as much astonished
as the others at such an unusual occurrence,
and gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>“To resume business,” she said. “Now,
the first thing to do is for the sparrow to fly
back to the place where Nancy lives and
find out what’s going on, and when the best
time will be for us to carry out our project.
<i>I</i> should say ’twould be well to take some
time when she’s out selling her matches.”</p>

<p>“O. K.,” answered the sparrow. “I’ll
tear myself away for a while if you think
you can spare me long enough, my dear,”
he said to the barn-cat.</p>

<p>“Get along with you!” said the barn-cat
testily.</p>

<p>“Don’t be harsh to a fellow,” answered
the sparrow. “You know, my dear creature,
that you’ll count the hours till I come
back!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“Count the fiddlesticks!” ejaculated the
barn-cat, trying to look stern, but very
much inclined to smile at the fellow’s
impudence.</p>

<p>“Give me a piece of your lump of sugar
to take to the old lady,” he said to the
canary; “that will make it all right with
her;” and he helped himself to the lump
that was wedged in between the bars of the
canary’s cage. “Now I’m off. Ta, ta, my
love!” he said to the barn-cat as he blew a
kiss to her and was off like a shot.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> sparrow flew away, holding the
lump of sugar tightly in his claw.</p>

<p>“It’s a long time since I was at home,”
he said to himself as he flew along; “I
don’t dare to think how long it is. The old
lady’ll be pretty hard to bring ’round, I
suspect, but she’s a good little thing and
will make up before long. Let me see&mdash;the
youngsters must be ’most ready to fly
by this time. ’Tis a shame, I declare,
to neglect my family so. Well, I guess
I’ll take Mrs. Polly’s advice and settle
down.”</p>

<p>He passed over a clear spring in the
woods, and lit on the edge to drink. As he
stooped over to reach the fresh water he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>caught sight of himself reflected in the
smooth surface.</p>

<p>“Whew! I do look rather rowdy,” he
said. “I think I’ll take a dip,&mdash;there’s
nothing that takes with the female sex like
a little attention to your personal appearance,
and I flatter myself I’m not a bad-looking
fellow when I’m spruced up. So
here goes!” and carefully placing the lump
of sugar on a stone, he ducked his head into
the fresh, clear water, and brought it out
dripping.</p>

<p>Then he stepped in and splashed the
water about with his wings, and ducked
his head till his feathers were heavy with
water. He flew into a bush and began
pluming them carefully, and he certainly
was <i>not</i> a bad-looking fellow when he had
finished his toilet.</p>

<p>When he had smoothed out all his feathers
he flew down to the edge of the spring
and looked in, and, judging from the little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>complacent nod he gave and the dapper air
with which he hopped to the stone where
the lump of sugar lay, he was evidently
satisfied with the picture he saw reflected.</p>

<p>“Now for home!” he said; and mounting
into the air he circled a few times over the
spring, and then flew straight to his home,
still holding the lump of sugar securely in
his little claw.</p>

<p>A small unpainted house stood back from
the road. The whole place had a dilapidated
look,&mdash;the gate was off the hinges;
most of the blinds were gone, and those that
were left were broken or hanging by one
hinge; the shingles were off the roof in
many places; and panes of glass were gone
from many of the windows, the holes being
filled up with bundles of rags.</p>

<p>A shed that looked as if it were ready to
tumble down at any moment was built on to
the back of the house; and a large elm, the
only pretty thing about the place, spread
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>its drooping branches over the moss-grown
roof.</p>

<p>To this tree the sparrow made his way,
and lighted on a branch before a little bird-house
which looked as much out of repair
as the house itself; for it seemed ready to
fall apart at any moment, and the bits of
seaweed and straw and wool of which the
nest was made, were hanging out of the
door in a most untidy manner. In fact,
the whole structure had an insecure appearance,
as if a high wind might topple it over
at any moment.</p>

<p>A little bright-eyed sparrow stood in the
doorway, and three small sparrows from
the nest inside opened their mouths wide
and clamored expectantly for something to
eat as the sparrow lighted beside them.</p>

<p>“How do you do, my darling?” said the
sparrow gayly, as he approached his little
bright-eyed wife for a kiss.</p>

<p>But instead of answering she turned her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>back towards him, and looked straight before
her with what she intended to be a
very severe expression; but the truth was,
her natural expression was so good-natured
and pleasing that she didn’t succeed so well
as she thought she did.</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it one little kiss for its husband
that’s been away so long?” asked
the sparrow, trying to get a view of the face
she turned away from him.</p>

<p>“No, it hasn’t,” answered the little wife
shortly, without looking at him.</p>

<p>“If you knew how I’ve longed to see you
all this time!” said the sparrow, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t you come and see
me?” said the bright-eyed sparrow, with
what she considered a very sarcastic laugh,
but which didn’t frighten her husband one
bit. “I didn’t run away. I’ve been here
all this time, working hard to feed these
three children. It’s mean of you to treat
me so!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>“So ’tis, so ’tis, my dear,” answered her
husband soothingly.</p>

<p>“Then why in the world’s name didn’t
you come?”</p>

<p>“Business, my dear, business,” answered
the sparrow with a very important air;
“business before pleasure, you know.”</p>

<p>“A likely story! As if you ever did a
day’s work in your life! All my friends
told me how ’twould be if I married you!”</p>

<p>“Then what made you do it, my love?”
said the sparrow in a very sweet voice,
dropping a kiss on the back of the little
head that was turned away so persistently.</p>

<p>“Because I was a fool, I suppose,” answered
the bright-eyed sparrow; “I don’t
know any other reason. There was that
other one that wanted me to have him,&mdash;well
off and a hard-working fellow. I don’t
know why in the world I didn’t take him,
instead of a vain, lazy, flirting fellow like
you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>“I know, my dear, why you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Why, I should like to know, sir?” she
said, turning her bright eyes towards him
for an instant and then looking away again.</p>

<p>“Because, my darling, you knew that,
in spite of his good qualities that you respected
you loved a good-for-nothing, lazy
fellow, good-looking enough,” said the sparrow
with a conceited little air, “but whose
only virtue was that he cared more for one
look from your bright eyes than for all the
rest of the world put together;” and he lit
beside her, and stretching out his neck gave
her an affectionate kiss.</p>

<p>“Don’t!” said his little wife with a pout;
“you don’t mean it, you know you don’t.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I, though?” answered her husband.
“Come, my dear, it isn’t becoming
to you to be cross. Be the pretty, happy
little thing you are, and tell your mean old
husband that you’re glad to see him home
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>The bright-eyed sparrow didn’t <i>say</i> she
was glad, but she didn’t turn from him
as he sat close to her in the doorway of
the little house, and it was evident she
rather liked it, or she would have moved
away.</p>

<p>“You haven’t seen the children since
they got their new feathers,” she said.
“You don’t know what a hard time I’ve
had finding food for them all this time, and
they are <i>such</i> big eaters! And the house
leaks, and sometimes it rocks so I expect
every minute it will fall down. It was
very unkind of you to leave me so long!”
and the bright eyes were full of tears.</p>

<p>“I won’t again, my dear, ’pon my honor!”
said the sparrow. “’Twas too bad. Come,
let’s make up, and I’ll show you what I’ve
brought you.”</p>

<p>He was so good-natured, and looked so
handsome and fresh in consequence of his
bath, that his poor little wife couldn’t resist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>him any longer, and their little bills met in
a kiss of peace.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that?” said the
sparrow, holding out the lump of sugar to
her.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Taste and see,” he answered, holding it
up to her mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh, how delicious!” she exclaimed,
biting off a few grains.</p>

<p>“You see your husband does think of
you when he’s away on business,” said the
sparrow tenderly.</p>

<p>“Let us have a bite!” called out the
baby sparrows vociferously.</p>

<p>So the mother bird bit off a piece for
each one, and then promised them they
should have the rest the next day.</p>

<p>“They don’t know their own father, the
poor dears!” said the little mother.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame,” answered the sparrow.
“Hallo, young ones!” he said, whistling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>for their entertainment, “when you’re able
to fly, your dad’ll take you out for an airing
occasionally.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get that nice white
stuff?” asked the little bright-eyed sparrow.</p>

<p>Then the sparrow told all about Posy
and Tom, and the parrot and the canary,
and the house-cat and the barn-cat, and the
good luck of the little gray kitten, and how
they were trying to bring about a change
of luck for little Nancy, and how the ugly
rats were plotting to prevent it; and the little
bright-eyed sparrow nestled affectionately
against him, and listened to every word
that he uttered with the greatest interest.</p>

<p>“How is Nancy getting on?” asked the
sparrow as he ended his story.</p>

<p>“Poor child! I pity her with all my
heart,” said the bright-eyed sparrow. “She
never gets anything to eat but she comes
out and sprinkles some of the crumbs under
the tree for us, and then she throws some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>around the door-step of the old shed for
the mice.”</p>

<p>“I must have a look at her,” said the
sparrow. “Where is she now? do you
know?”</p>

<p>“She came home about five minutes before
you did,” said the little bright-eyed
sparrow; “and I’m afraid she hasn’t sold
any matches to-day, she looked so sad.”</p>

<p>Just then the shed-door opened, and a little
girl appeared, and seating herself under
the elm-tree began to sob as if her heart
would break.</p>

<p>“Is Posy as big as she is?” whispered
the little bright-eyed sparrow, “and does
she look anything like her?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” answered her husband;
“Posy is a very little girl, and has beautiful
yellow hair and red cheeks, and always
dances about because she is so happy. We
<i>must</i> do something for this poor child!”</p>

<p>The child sat with her face buried in her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>hands, sobbing; and the sparrow noticed
that her bare feet were cut in many places
from walking over the sharp stones. They
were red and swollen too. He flew down
and perched on a bush in front of her, for
the good-hearted fellow longed to comfort
her.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” said the little girl, “how my
feet do ache!” and she took one of them
in her hands, and rocked herself backward
and forward with the pain.</p>

<p>The sparrow gave a cheerful twitter, and
the child looked up.</p>

<p>“Why, I do believe it’s Billy come
back!” she cried, almost smiling through
her tears. “Why, you’re a naughty bird
to leave your wife and babies so long!”</p>

<p>Billy twittered and chirped, and tried hard
to tell her how glad he was to see her.</p>

<p>“I’ve had a hard time, Billy, since you
went away,” she said, “and it’s a comfort to
have you back again, for it always seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>to me as if you understood what I told you,
and I’ve nobody in the whole world to love
me, Billy;” and the tears streamed down her
cheeks. “She’s awful cross to me, Billy,
and often beats me; and when I can’t sell
my matches she makes me go without anything
to eat.  A kind lady gave me a piece
of bread to-day, and I saved some of the
crumbs for your little wife to give her
babies, and I’ll give some to you, too,
because you’re the only friend I have besides
your wife, now that the little gray
kitten has gone;” and the little girl put a
few crumbs on the ground in front of the
sparrow.</p>

<p>“If I were to eat one of those crumbs I
believe it would choke me,” he called up to
his little wife, who was watching them as
she softly sang her babies to sleep.</p>

<p>“My feet are very sore, Billy,” went on
the child; “for, you see, I have to go very
far to sell my matches, and I think I should
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>feel stronger if I had more to eat. I sometimes
think that I can’t stand it any longer;”
and the poor child began to sob again.</p>

<p>The sparrow felt very sorry for her, and
told her what her friends the animals were
going to do for her, and how happy she
would be when she found herself in a new
home. “If they felt so sorry for the little
gray kitten, think how they’ll pity you,
you poor ill-used child!” he said. “And
Posy and Tom will play with you, and you’ll
have shoes and stockings to wear, and plenty
to eat, and a nice place to sleep in; so don’t
cry, little Nancy, for very good times are
coming!”</p>

<p>This is what the sparrow said, but the
child did not understand the words.</p>

<p>“I believe you’re trying to comfort me,
you dear thing,” she said, “when you sing
so cheerfully; and it makes me forget how
hungry I am, and my feet don’t hurt me so
much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>“The sun has gone down and it’s time to
go to bed,” called out the little bright-eyed
sparrow after the child and the sparrow had
talked together in this manner for some
time. “I always like to have the house
quiet by sundown.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s only just the edge of the
evening,” answered the sparrow; “I guess
I’ll call ’round on some of my old friends.
I’ll be back in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“I know your tricks,” said his little wife;
“you’ll come home by daybreak, and then
you’ll want to sleep till noon. ‘The early
bird catches the worm,’ my mother used to
say; and true enough it is. It’s too bad to
have you go off so soon, when I was so glad
to have you back again! I’ve lots of things
to tell you;” and the bright-eyed sparrow’s
eyes filled with tears of disappointment.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t cry, and I’ll stay at home,”
said the sparrow, as he flew up to the nest;
and nestling close together they talked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>until their voices grew sleepy, and then
each little head was tucked under a wing,
and both were fast asleep.</p>

<p>Then the child arose, and limping went
slowly into the house.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> the sparrow awoke the next
morning he found his little mate had
been up some time and had given the young
sparrows their breakfast; so he made a
hasty toilet, and then flew off to find something
to eat.</p>

<p>He remembered just where the finest
worms were to be found, and he ate a few
and saved two of the largest and fattest for
his little wife.</p>

<p>Nancy was coming out of the gate as he
flew in, and was starting out for her day’s
work with her basket of matches on her
arm.</p>

<p>“Good-by, dear Billy,” she said, as he
lighted on the rickety gate and looked at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>her. “Don’t run away again, I miss you
so dreadfully.”</p>

<p>The sparrow laid the worms carefully on
the top bar of the gate, but kept one eye on
them for fear they would crawl away.</p>

<p>“You’ll see me back in a day or two,”
he said with a cheerful nod of the head,
“and it’s a pity you don’t know that your
hard days are ’most over. Keep up courage,
little Nancy, and you’ll soon be as
happy as a queen.”</p>

<p>“That was a very cheerful little song,”
she said. “I see you’re taking those great
fat worms home to your wife. I suppose
she’ll like them as well as we do sausages,
though.”</p>

<p>“Nancy,” called a sharp voice from the
window, “what are you loitering there
for? Go along, you lazy thing!” and at
the words Nancy hurried away, and the
sparrow caught up his worms and flew
home as fast as his wings could carry him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>How pleased the little bright-eyed sparrow
was with the worms, and how lovingly
she watched her little mate as she ate them
and divided them with her little ones! It
was so pleasant to have him back again
after those dreary days!</p>

<p>“I think I’ll move you all over to the
place I was telling you about,” said the
sparrow. “There are plenty of fine building-spots
there, and this old shanty is in a
pretty bad condition. Everything is handy
there, too, and I don’t consider this a very
genteel neighborhood.”</p>

<p>“If we live here much longer, something
will have to be done to the house; it really
isn’t safe in a high wind.”</p>

<p>“Well, as soon as we get this business
settled about Nancy, I’ll pick out a good
situation and build,” answered the sparrow.
“Now I’ll be off, for there’s no time to
lose, as I promised Mrs. Polly I’d be back
in good season.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>“Do come again as soon as you can,”
said the bright-eyed sparrow, blowing some
dust off his neck; “I shall miss you dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“You’ll see me back just as soon as I can
get hold of that piece of silk,&mdash;perhaps
to-morrow. It all depends upon Posy, you
know. Good-by, my dear;” and he kissed
his little wife very affectionately. “Good-by,
young uns;” and he was off again.
As he looked back he saw the little bright-eyed
sparrow standing in the doorway and
looking wistfully after him, and he threw
her a kiss before he passed out of sight.
“She’s a dear little thing,” he said to himself,
“and I know I’m not half good enough
for her, but I really won’t stay away so
long again. It wasn’t very comfortable at
home then, I must confess; the babies were
little, and teasing for food most of the time,
and she was so taken up with them that she
didn’t take much notice of me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>With these thoughts passing through his
little brain the sparrow sped on till he
came in sight of the house where Posy and
Tom lived. He flew straight to the dining-room
window, and found Mrs. Polly and the
canary delighted to see him back.</p>

<p>“Don’t begin your story till the barn-cat
and the house-cat are here,” said Mrs. Polly;
“they’ll be very anxious to hear it;” and
Polly gave a shrill whistle in imitation of
the noise boys make when they whistle
through two of their fingers. It was repeated
several times, until Mrs. Winton
called from her chamber window,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t make such a frightful noise,
Polly; you’ll drive me crazy.”</p>

<p>Soon the barn-cat appeared hurrying
along, and the house-cat followed more
slowly, for she considered a graceful and
dignified carriage of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>“How are you, my dear creature?” said
the sparrow to the barn-cat; “I knew you’d
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>pine away while I was gone. I’ve thought
of you every minute, too, and couldn’t stay
away from you any longer.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make a fool of yourself,” answered
the barn-cat crustily.</p>

<p>“Come, let’s proceed to business,” said
Mrs. Polly, her quick eye interrupting a
very loving glance that the sparrow was bestowing
on the barn-cat. “What have you
seen and heard about the child Nancy?”</p>

<p>“I’ve both seen and heard her,” answered
the sparrow. “She confides all her troubles
to me, but she thinks I can’t understand a
word she tells me; and when I’ve told her
how sorry I am for her and what we’re
going to do for her, she often says, ‘What
a pretty little song that was, Billy! it seems
as if you wanted to comfort me.’”</p>

<p>“Well, how is she getting on?” asked
Mrs. Polly.</p>

<p>“Worse than ever. She has to walk
very far to sell her matches, to places where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>she has never been before, and her feet are
lame and painful. We must get her away
from there as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t be surprised if Posy would
bring out her sewing soon,” said the house-cat.
“I heard Mrs. Winton tell her she
didn’t like to have her run about in the
hot sun so much,&mdash;that she had better take
her playthings on the piazza where it was
cool; and Posy said, ‘I guess I’d better
make a new dress for my dolly, for her’s
hardly got a dress after her name.’”</p>

<p>A slight rustling was heard behind the
bush where the sparrow was seated, and all
quickly turned in that direction. Before
the others knew what had happened, the
barn-cat was down from the window and in
the bush, and the next minute they saw her
chasing a large rat across the yard towards
the barn. Quickly as he ran, they saw he
was old and gray about the mouth; and
when he turned and gave a quick look back,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>they saw he had long yellow teeth with one
of them broken off.</p>

<p>“Graywhisker!” they all exclaimed in a
breath. “If she can only get him!”</p>

<p>Quick as the barn-cat was, old Graywhisker
was quicker, and darted into a hole
under the barn that was the private entrance
of the rats, just as the barn-cat
reached it. She had the satisfaction of
clawing the tip of his tail; but it was too
slippery for her to hold, and it slipped
through her claws. She went back to her
companions with rather a crestfallen air.</p>

<p>“Splendidly done, my dear creature!”
said the sparrow; “you almost got him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have him yet,” said the barn-cat as
she washed her rumpled fur; “to think of
his listening again to our conversation!”</p>

<p>“He can’t do any harm, fortunately,”
said Mrs. Polly. “All he can do is to
sneak around and play the spy.”</p>

<p>“I sometimes fear that he may do the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>little gray kitten some mischief,” said the
canary; “she is so small and helpless, and
Major says he has so much spite against
her.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t <i>dare</i> to touch her,” said
the barn-cat fiercely. “I wouldn’t sleep a
wink till I’d paid him off if he harmed her.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” twittered the sparrow, “the
children are coming.”</p>

<p>Posy appeared, dancing along in her
usual happy way, with the corners of her
little white apron held up with one hand
and in the other a small china doll. When
she reached the piazza, she let the corners
of the apron fall, and out rolled the contents,&mdash;bits
of bright-colored ribbon and
silk and lace.</p>

<p>“Now, my dear Miss Pompadour,” said
Posy to the china doll, “you sit right down
here while your mamma makes you a beautiful
ball-dress. You must be very careful
of it, because it’s going to be made of my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>very bestest piece of silk;” and Posy held
before the dolly’s eyes a piece of red ribbon
with figures of gold thread embroidered
on it.</p>

<p>“That’s gold, Miss Pompadour,” continued
Posy,&mdash;“those bright yellow spots. I
don’t suppose you know it, for you don’t
know much, and what little you do know
you don’t know <i>for certain</i>. And I shall
make a pocket in it, because you’re very
apt to lose your handkerchiefs. I showed
a pocket in one of your dresses to Harry
Mason the other day, and he said, ‘Ho!
that isn’t a pocket! that’s only a rag of a
pocket!’ I told Tom about it, and he said
Harry Mason was a very unpolite boy!”</p>

<p>A little twitter in front of her made Posy
look up from her work, and hopping on the
gravelled walk was a little sparrow. He
didn’t seem to be at all afraid of her,
and hopped about and twittered in a very
cheerful way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>Then came the barn-cat stealing softly
towards the little sparrow. She would take
a few steps, and then sit down and pretend
she didn’t see him. He evidently didn’t
see her, for instead of flying away he
hopped about as confidently as if there were
no such thing as a cat in the world.</p>

<p>The barn-cat came nearer still, and
crouched in the way she always did before
she sprang, and Posy couldn’t bear it any
longer.</p>

<p>“Go away, you naughty kitty!” cried
Posy, dropping her work; and running towards
the barn-cat she caught her up in
her arms.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t catch the dear little birdies;
I’ve told you so a great many times,”
said Posy, walking towards the barn with
her. “You go and stay with your babies,
and try to catch some of the ugly old rats.
Michael says they eat up Major’s oats, and
he’s going to buy a trap and catch ’em in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>it;” and Posy put the barn-cat inside the
barn-door, and then went back to her
work.</p>

<p>She didn’t see a pair of small bright eyes
shining in a hole around the corner of the
barn, nor see the ugly face with gray whiskers
they belonged to; nor did she hear
him say with a vicious smile, “Catch ’em in
a trap, will he? I guess he’ll find out that
it isn’t so easy to catch an old rat as he
thinks. Look out, my dear Posy! you may
hear from the ugly rats in a way you don’t
like.”</p>

<p>Posy went back to her work on the
piazza; but the sparrow had flown away,
and Posy hunted in vain for her little piece
of red ribbon with the gold figures embroidered
on it.</p>

<p>“Where has that ribbon gone?” said
Posy, anxiously pulling over the little heap
of bright-colored silks. “Dear me! the very
beautifulest piece I had, and I was going to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>make a ball-dress for Miss Pompadour out
of it. How disappointed her will be!”
and Posy was almost ready to cry with
disappointment herself.</p>

<p>All this time the sparrow had the piece of
red ribbon safe in his little claw, and was
flying away with it to the old swallow’s
nest under the eaves of the piazza where
he had slept of late.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> little sparrow went to bed early
that night, that he might be up by
daybreak the next morning and start on his
expedition to Nancy before the family were
stirring.</p>

<p>Pleasant dreams of the happiness awaiting
the forlorn child passed through his little
brain, and he took his head from under
his wing as the first faint streak of daylight
appeared in the east.</p>

<p>This morning he omitted his usual cheerful
twitter, there was no time for that; so
he jumped up and looked around for the
little piece of red ribbon with the gold figures
on it. Where was it? He was certain
he had placed it carefully in the nest,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>for it was the last thing he saw before he
went to sleep.</p>

<p>“What in the world has become of that
ribbon?” he said aloud. “I am sure I put
it on this side of the nest, where it couldn’t
possibly blow away;” and he pecked apart
the lining of the nest and peeped everywhere
in vain.</p>

<p>“It couldn’t possibly have blown away,
but I’ll look everywhere;” and he carefully
examined the ground under the nest
and the trees and bushes,&mdash;everywhere
where it was possible for a ribbon to
lodge.</p>

<p>By this time the sun was up and Hannah
had come downstairs. As soon as she
opened the dining-room window to air the
room, the sparrow flew straight to Mrs.
Polly, about as anxious-looking a bird as
you would wish to see.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pretty fix,” he began; “the
ribbon’s gone!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span></p>

<p>“Gone!” exclaimed Mrs. Polly, “gone
where?”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew,” answered the sparrow
shortly.</p>

<p>“Explain yourself, please,” said Mrs. Polly;
“it’s all Greek to me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I went to bed last night in good
season, so as to be up early this morning
and start before anybody was stirring.
Well, when I woke and was just going to
start, no ribbon was to be found.”</p>

<p>“Careless fellow!” said Mrs. Polly, rubbing
her nose with vexation; “why couldn’t
you put it where it would be safe?”</p>

<p>“I did. I looked at it the last thing before
I went to sleep.”</p>

<p>“It probably blew away.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t blow away; it was in the
bottom of the nest, and besides I’ve hunted
everywhere and it’s not to be found.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s only one way to account
for it,” said Mrs. Polly, with a decided nod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Thieves!” answered Mrs. Polly shortly.</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled the sparrow; “then
I suppose it’s a hopeless case.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why,” said Mrs. Polly
shrewdly.</p>

<p>“How are we going to find them out?
Nobody saw ’em come in the night.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly put her head on one side with
a very knowing look, and cleared her throat
gravely.</p>

<p>“We’ll track them,” she said. “Whoever
it was must have left some signs behind
them. I am tied down here and must trust
to you to make investigations; but if you
act according to my directions, I don’t doubt
but that we’ll get to the bottom of the matter
before long.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the sparrow; “just
say what you want done, and I’m your
man.”</p>

<p>“The first thing to do,” said Mrs. Polly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>“is to examine carefully the premises.
Look on the ground for footprints, and then
closely examine the pillar that leads up to
the nest, to see if the thieves came that way.”</p>

<p>“Why, what other way could they come,
pray?”</p>

<p>“They could fly, couldn’t they?”</p>

<p>The sparrow looked rather ashamed of
his slowness of comprehension and made no
reply; but then he wasn’t expected to be
as shrewd as Mrs. Polly with her many
years of experience.</p>

<p>“The sooner you begin the better,” said
Mrs. Polly; “and come back and report to
me when you are through.”</p>

<p>The sparrow flew off and lighted on the
ground under the nest. A flower-bed stood
there, and he made a careful examination.
Not a leaf was out of place that he could
see, and not a plant disturbed in any way.</p>

<p>Then he pushed the branches carefully
aside and examined the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>“Aha!” said the sparrow, with a satisfied
little nod; “I begin to smell a mice.
Somebody’s been here, that’s certain; but
whether these tracks were made by a bird
or a chicken or&mdash;” and he brought his
bright little eyes nearer the ground. Yes,
he was pretty sure now. The soft earth
was marked by the traces of little feet, but
so close together that he couldn’t make
out the exact form; but just beyond were
several larger ones, and he thought he knew
to whose feet they belonged. “I guess I
know whose foot that shoe will fit,” he said
to himself.</p>

<p>Next he looked up towards the nest. A
nasturtium vine was trained against the pillar,
and pieces of twine formed a trellis for
it to cling to. The sparrow ran his eye
carefully over it. “I thought so,” he said
to himself; “’twas he.”</p>

<p>The delicate leaves of the plant were
broken in several places, and hanging to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>stem; and in one place the stem itself was
torn away from the twine as if too heavy a
strain had been brought to bear on it.</p>

<p>The sparrow had seen enough to satisfy
himself, and flew back to Mrs. Polly.</p>

<p>“Well?” she asked inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered the sparrow, “I guess
I’ve as good as caught the fellow.”</p>

<p>“Tell me what you found, and I’ll draw
my own conclusions,” said Mrs. Polly, putting
her head on one side with the knowing
expression she always assumed when
listening to a story.</p>

<p>“In the first place, the flowers were not
broken, not a leaf harmed. That shows that
whoever it was, was small enough to walk
under ’em.”</p>

<p>“Very good,” said Mrs. Polly, with an
encouraging nod; “go on.”</p>

<p>“Then I found a lot of tracks, but they
were so close together that I couldn’t make
out what kind of animal they belonged to;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>but a little farther off I saw some bigger
ones, and I’ll be shot if they don’t belong
to Graywhisker. Then I found the nasturtium
vine broken in several places, and
it is evident the old fellow got up that way.
I sleep pretty sound when my head’s under
my wing, and he might carry off the whole
nest without waking me.”</p>

<p>“You’ve done well,” said Mrs. Polly,
with an approving smile, “very well for an
inexperienced hand. Now I’ll give you
<i>my</i> opinion;” and she looked so wise, and
was evidently so perfectly satisfied with her
own shrewdness, that the young sparrow
felt greatly flattered to be praised by so
distinguished a person.</p>

<p>“You are right in concluding that Graywhisker
was there,” said Mrs. Polly, “but
you’re wrong in thinking he climbed up
the nasturtium vine.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think he did, then?” asked
the sparrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” answered Mrs. Polly
decidedly.</p>

<p>“Who did, then?”</p>

<p>“Not Graywhisker, you may depend on
that; he has too old a head. He laid his
plans and superintended the affair, but you
wouldn’t catch him trusting his precious
old neck on that delicate vine. Besides, in
case the thief were caught he would want
to keep his own neck safe. No, indeed,”
continued Mrs. Polly, shaking her head
sagely; “not he, indeed!”</p>

<p>“Who did go up the vine, then?” asked
the sparrow, very much impressed by Mrs.
Polly’s wisdom.</p>

<p>“That I’m not prepared to say,” answered
Mrs. Polly, with a shrug of her
shoulders; “perhaps he sent one of the young
rats, but I rather incline to the opinion that
it was a mouse; even a young rat would
be too heavy, and then young rats are stupid.
Yes, I’m pretty sure ’twas a mouse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>“What’s to be done next?” asked the
sparrow.</p>

<p>“You young fellows are always in too
much of a hurry,” said Mrs. Polly; “we
must wait and see what turns up next.
‘Murder will out,’ you know; and if we
keep our ears and eyes open, we shall get
some clew to the thief.”</p>

<p>“And meanwhile that poor child Nancy
will have to go on with her hard life. She
said she sometimes felt as if she couldn’t
bear it any longer,” said the sparrow in a
despondent tone.</p>

<p>“Make the best of it, my friend,” answered
Mrs. Polly. “We’ll do the best
we can for her. In the mean time don’t
talk about the matter; for if Graywhisker
finds out we suspect him, he’ll be on his
guard and we shan’t find a clew to the
missing ribbon.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose the only thing to do is to
wait patiently,” said the sparrow, with a sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>Before long, the barn-cat, and the house-cat,
and the little gray kitten, and Major, all
knew of the theft of the red ribbon with the
gold figures on it, and they grieved sadly
over the disappointment. They all took
Mrs. Polly’s advice not to talk about it, and
Graywhisker’s name was not mentioned
among them.</p>

<p>“How quiet the birds are to-day!”
said Tom to Posy that afternoon; “I
haven’t heard the canary sing once to-day.”</p>

<p>“That’s so!” said Mrs. Polly dryly.</p>

<p>The children burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Do you feel sick to-day, Mrs. Polly?”
asked Posy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly gave a loud sneeze for answer.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve got cold, ma’am,” said
Posy.</p>

<p>Just then Michael drove down the yard
on his way to the depot to meet Mr. Winton;
and when the carriage was opposite the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>dining-room window, Major called out to
Mrs. Polly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I’ve got something very important to
tell you. Send the barn-cat or the sparrow
to my stall when I get back. You’d better
send the sparrow, he can get so near me I
don’t have to holla.”</p>

<p class="p2b">“What a loud neigh Major did give,
Tom!” said Posy. “I guess, by the way
he looked at the dining-room window, he
wanted a lump of sugar.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">S</span>erene</span> as Mrs. Polly’s temperament
was, and although she gave the sparrow
such good advice, she found it very
hard to keep patient herself until the sparrow
appeared.</p>

<p>She felt certain that the important news
Major had to communicate related to the
lost ribbon, and she was almost bursting
with curiosity to know what it was. It
would not do to call the sparrow, for old
Graywhisker had sharper ears than he
had; so the only thing to be done was to
control her impatience until the sparrow
appeared. What if he didn’t come back
until after the barn was closed for the
night?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>It was a horrible thought, and it made
her break out into a cold perspiration, for
he was a queer fellow and his movements
could never be relied on. Just as
likely as not he might take it into his head
to make another visit to his family, or go off
with some friend and not come back again
before midnight.</p>

<p>“There he is,” whispered the canary
suddenly; “I can see him swinging on the
top of that laburnum-tree. I know him by
the way he bobs his head, and twitches his
tail.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly looked in the direction indicated
by the canary; and there he was,
swinging on a slender branch of the laburnum-tree
as unconcernedly as if he hadn’t
a care in the world.</p>

<p>“Flirting with that little wren,” said Mrs.
Polly indignantly. “It doesn’t look well
for a family man. I <i>did</i> hope he was going
to settle down, but I see he’s a hopeless case.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>“He’s good-hearted,” said the canary.</p>

<p>“Yes, his heart’s good enough,” answered
Mrs. Polly; “but you can’t rely on him.
There’s no knowing what he’ll take it into
his head to do next.”</p>

<p>Just then the sparrow looked in the direction
of the dining-room window; and as Mrs.
Polly caught his eye she beckoned to him.
He returned the signal, but went on saying
a few last words; and from his gallant
manner and the coquettish air with which
the wren listened to him, it was very evident
he wouldn’t have cared to have the
little bright-eyed sparrow happen by just
then.</p>

<p>“Hopeless!” said Mrs. Polly to herself,
as he came flying towards her with a pleasant
smile, evidently caused by his parting
words with the wren; “little does he care
who stole the ribbon if he can only have a
good time!” and she received him rather
crustily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span></p>

<p>“Hope I haven’t kept you waiting too
long,” said the sparrow cheerfully; “didn’t
see you till just now.”</p>

<p>“No, I observed you didn’t,” answered
Mrs. Polly in a severe tone.</p>

<p>“Met my cousin the wren, and didn’t
like to pass without speaking to her a
minute.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed!” said Mrs. Polly dryly.</p>

<p>“Anything up?” asked the sparrow.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Mrs. Polly; “Major
wants you to go around to his stall after he
comes home from the depot,&mdash;he has something
important to say, and you can get
nearer to him than the barn-cat can.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said the sparrow, “I’ll be
on hand.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t meet any more of
your <i>cousins</i>,” said Mrs. Polly sarcastically;
“because you know it might interfere with
your engagement with Major.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” said the sparrow, “I’ll
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>be there;” and off he flew and perched
himself on one of the topmost boughs of
the great elm that hung over the gate.</p>

<p>“Good-natured fellow,” said Mrs. Polly
to herself, as she watched his graceful motions,
“but I don’t believe he’ll ever amount
to anything.”</p>

<p>The sparrow sat balancing himself on the
bough of the great elm until he saw Major
appear and until Michael had unharnessed
him and led him into his stall. Then he
flew in through the little window above the
stall, and lighted on the edge of the manger
close to Major’s face.</p>

<p>“We’ve chosen a good time,” whispered
Major, “while Michael is getting my supper
and spreading down my bedding for
the night; the rats keep out of the way
while he is around. Come a little bit nearer,
if you please, so that I can whisper in your
ear.”</p>

<p>The little sparrow came as near as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>could, and Major put his big mouth close to
his little ear as he sat perched on the edge
of the manger. How small he did look, to
be sure, by the side of the great horse; but
he was a bright little fellow if he was
small.</p>

<p>“Last night,” whispered Major, “I didn’t
sleep very well. I think I must have eaten
too much supper. Some time in the night
I heard voices over my head, and I can tell
you I listened with all my ears. One of
the voices I knew well enough,&mdash;it was
old Graywhisker’s; and the other was so
timid and weak I was quite sure it belonged
to little Mrs. Silverskin, and I soon found I
was right. They often go in and out at
night, because they know the barn-cat is
likely to be asleep; but I suspected from
their whispering that some mischief was up,
and I listened.</p>

<p>“‘I’m afraid the vine will break,’ said
Mrs. Silverskin; ‘I don’t dare venture on it.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“‘Nonsense!’ answered the old fellow;
‘it will hold fast enough.’</p>

<p>“But the little mouse protested she was
afraid, and then I heard her say, ‘I don’t like
to steal Posy’s ribbon, she thinks so much
of it.’</p>

<p>“‘Very well, ma’am,’ said old Graywhisker;
‘you just pack up and leave these premises
before to-morrow night, or you’ll be sorry.’</p>

<p>“‘Oh, don’t turn me out of doors!’ said
the poor little creature; ‘my babies are so
young they’ll die if you do.’</p>

<p>“‘So much the better!’ snarled the old
fellow.”</p>

<p>“The old villain!” said the sparrow.</p>

<p>“Well, the end of the matter was that
Mrs. Silverskin promised to do as he wished,
provided he would not turn her out of
doors; and you may be sure the ribbon’s
safe in old Graywhisker’s hole, where it’ll
stay in all probability, for I don’t know
anybody bold enough to venture in after it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>The sparrow was silent a moment, and
was about to speak when Major interrupted
him.</p>

<p>“Now you must go, for Michael is
through, and will close up for the night
before he leaves. Tell Mrs. Polly what
I’ve told you. Perhaps she can think of
some way out of this scrape; I’m sure
I can’t.”</p>

<p>The sparrow flew off at once to acquaint
Mrs. Polly with the news; but for the first
time since his acquaintance with her Mrs.
Polly did not prove equal to the emergency.
She gave a deep sigh, and shook
her head several times in a very despondent
manner.</p>

<p>“Can’t you think of some way to get
back that ribbon?” asked the sparrow.
“Posy feels so badly about it that I’m
sorry I didn’t take another one instead. I
was a fool. Any other bright one would
have done as well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>“The ribbon is in Graywhisker’s hole,
and there it will remain,” said Mrs. Polly
gloomily.</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said the canary, who
had been listening with great interest to the
story told by the sparrow, “that it might
be got out.”</p>

<p>“Pray give us the benefit of your wisdom,”
said Mrs. Polly in a sarcastic tone.
“To be sure, I’ve only lived in the world
about fifty times as long as you have,
but I’m not too proud to learn from
anybody.”</p>

<p>“Send somebody in for it when Graywhisker
is away from home,” answered the
canary.</p>

<p>“Who, pray?” asked Mrs. Polly in the
same sarcastic tone; and she muttered something
to herself that sounded very like
“You fool!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mrs. Silverskin would be willing
to go for it. She’s very fond of Posy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>you know, and the sparrow tells us that
she objected to stealing the ribbon on that
account.”</p>

<p>“Absurd!” exclaimed Mrs. Polly in a
contemptuous tone. “Why, she’s afraid
of her own shadow! I can assure you it
would take a good deal of courage to venture
into any rat’s hole, let alone old Graywhisker’s!
Why, where do you think
she’d be if he came back and found her
there?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it would be a pretty dangerous
undertaking,” said the canary meekly.</p>

<p>“I <i>suppose</i> it would too!” sneered the
parrot. “No, that’s out of the question; so
that settles the matter.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said the sparrow
dryly.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Mrs. Polly
sharply. “Don’t speak in riddles.”</p>

<p>“I mean what I say,” answered the sparrow,
boldly returning Mrs. Polly’s glance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>“I said I didn’t know about that. I’m not
so sure that nobody will dare venture into
Graywhisker’s hole.”</p>

<p>“Who will, pray?” said Mrs. Polly.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> will,” answered the sparrow firmly.
“I’ll go into Graywhisker’s hole and get
that ribbon back if it’s there.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly and the canary stared at the
little sparrow in astonishment too great for
words.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“D</span>o</span> you know what you are saying?”
said Mrs. Polly, when she had recovered
from her astonishment sufficiently to
speak.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if I did,” answered
the sparrow carelessly.</p>

<p>“Have you considered well the danger?”
asked Mrs. Polly gravely.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother the danger!” exclaimed the
sparrow impatiently. “Suppose the old
villain does come home and eat me up?
Well, there’ll only be one sparrow less in
the world.”</p>

<p>“But you’re a family man. What will
become of your wife and children if you are
killed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>“My wife and children are pretty well
used to taking care of themselves, and
they’ll be as well off without me as with
me. There’s a great advantage in the
vagabond life I’ve led; and being of no
use in the world you won’t be missed, and
that’s a comfort;” and the sparrow laughed
recklessly.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so,” said Mrs. Polly; “you
know you don’t mean it.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I don’t,” said the sparrow
carelessly.</p>

<p>“You’ve got on your blue spectacles to-day,
I guess,” said Mrs. Polly, “and you like
to make yourself out worse than you are.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure <i>we</i> should miss you very
much,” said the canary. “We have so
little variety to our lives, shut up here in
these cages, that it’s very pleasant to have
you coming and going, and bringing us
news from the busy world. Why, we
should never have known about little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>Nancy if it hadn’t been for you; and you
are the one who is to bring her here, and
now you are about to venture into Graywhisker’s
hole and find the ribbon. Why,
you’re the bravest fellow I know! Don’t
say you’re of no use in the world when
you can do so much!”</p>

<p>“You’re very kind,” said the sparrow,&mdash;and
his voice was somewhat husky, and his
eyes looked a little moist,&mdash;“to say such
pleasant things to a fellow. I don’t think I
ever had anybody say such pleasant things
to me before. I declare I believe I’ve got
a cold coming on;” and the sparrow made
a great effort to clear his throat.</p>

<p>“If you persist in doing this reckless
thing&mdash;” began Mrs. Polly.</p>

<p>“I <i>do</i> persist,” said the sparrow decidedly.</p>

<p>“You must take the opportunity when
Graywhisker is away from home,” continued
Mrs. Polly. “I don’t know much
about his habits myself, but Major can tell
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>you when he is likely to be out. Then let
the barn-cat watch at the entrance of the
hole, and you’re safe from him provided you
don’t come to harm in the hole.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly put her head on one side with
a meditative air, and the others were silent,
for they knew she was considering deeply
about the matter. After a few minutes’
silence she spoke.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what seems to me to be a
good plan,” she said to the sparrow. “You
see the barn-cat and whisper to her to take
her kittens out for an airing in front of the
barn. Graywhisker will be sure to see
them, and conclude that it’s safe for him to
leave home, for he never goes out while she
is in the barn. You watch from a distance,
and when he is gone you give the barn-cat
a sign and let her leave her kittens with the
little gray kitten while you slip into the
hole and she sits at the entrance. Do you
understand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I understand that it wouldn’t make
much difference to the barn-cat whether she
ate <i>me</i> or Graywhisker; on the whole, I’m
inclined to think she’d give me the preference.
No, I thank you, I’d rather meet
Graywhisker in the hole than have the
barn-cat watch the entrance while I’m in.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know but that you’re
right,” answered Mrs. Polly; “then we’ll
leave it this way. You wait for an opportunity
when Graywhisker is away and the
barn-cat too, and then you slip in and get
the ribbon. Major will point out his hole
to you.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered the sparrow cheerfully.
“I’ll take advantage of the first
opportunity;” and he flew off to the top of
a tall pear-tree that commanded a view of
the barn and yard. The parrot saw him
sit quietly there for some time, his little
head bobbing about in a very wide-awake
manner, and then suddenly fly down and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>dart into the window above Major’s stall.
She knew the desired opportunity had
come, and both she and the canary felt
great anxiety as to the result of such a
bold undertaking.</p>

<p>Just then Tom and Posy came out and
seated themselves on the steps of the piazza
to eat their lunch.</p>

<p>“Can’t you tell me a story, Tom?” asked
Posy; “I’ve told you ever so many nice
ones.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Tom, “let me see&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I’d rather hear about animals,” said
Posy.</p>

<p>“Well then, I guess I’ll tell you about a
hedgehog.”</p>

<p>“Oh dear!” said Posy, with a disappointed
air; “well, go on, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Once there was a hedgehog,” began
Tom, “who lived in a little hole in the
woods.”</p>

<p>“What?” asked Posy quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>“You mustn’t interrupt me, Posy,” said
Tom. “I said there was once a hedgehog
who lived in a little hole in the
woods.”</p>

<p>“But it <i>couldn’t</i>, you know,” said Posy,
with a perplexed expression.</p>

<p>“He could and he did,” continued Tom
decidedly; “and one day he started out
for a walk&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Why, Tom,” said Posy earnestly, “how
could a hedgehog take a walk? A hedgehog
is a kind of <i>barrel</i>, you know.”</p>

<p>“You mean hogshead,” said Tom; “what
a little goosie you are, Posy! But no matter,”
he continued, as Posy’s cheeks flushed
at her mistake; “the hedgehog started out
for a walk one morning, and before he’d
gone very far he met an old fox who lived
in a ledge of rocks near by. ‘Good-morning,
sir,’ said Mr. Fox, ‘this is a fine morning
to be out’&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tom,” said Posy suddenly, “I do believe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>the barn-cat is going to bring her kittens
out. Do look at her!”</p>

<p>The barn-cat sat in the doorway of the
barn, and moved her tail gently backward
and forward, occasionally uttering a low
“meaw” in a very coaxing tone and looking
behind her. Soon a little head appeared,
and then another, and two tiger-kittens began
to play with her tail. Then the barn-cat
stepped down from the doorway into
the yard, and went through the same performance
again. The tiger-kittens came to
the edge of the step and looked cautiously
over. The barn-cat pretended not to see
them, but kept her tail gently moving.</p>

<p>Then the tiger-kittens put first one paw
over the edge of the step, and then another,
and all at once they tumbled over into the
yard. Then what a play they did have!
They lay on their sides and kicked against
their mother, and then they made believe
frightened and galloped sideways up to her,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>with their backs arched and as fierce an
expression as their mild little eyes were
capable of producing.</p>

<p>“See the old cat make believe she doesn’t
see ’em, and yet she watches them out of
the corner of her eye all the time,” said
Tom.</p>

<p>Then the barn-cat began to wash herself,
and the kittens did the same; but they
didn’t do it in a very thorough manner,
for their little paws didn’t touch their faces
half of the time.</p>

<p>Then the barn-cat took up one of her
hind legs and washed it, and the kittens
tried to do the same; but they were such
little round balls they kept losing their balance,
and tumbled over every time they
lifted up their short hind legs.</p>

<p>Soon the barn-cat went into the barn,
leaving her kittens at play in the yard.</p>

<p>“That’s strange,” said Tom, “to leave her
kittens; she’s usually so careful of them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>In a few minutes the gray kitten came
out and seated herself near the tiger-kittens.</p>

<p>“I really believe,” said Posy, “that the
barn-cat sent the gray kitten out to take
care of her babies while she was out
hunting.”</p>

<p>When the barn-cat entered the barn, she
called the gray kitten to her and told her
she would like to have her take charge of
the kittens while she watched for a while at
Graywhisker’s hole, as she hadn’t seen him
leave the barn for a long time.</p>

<p>The gray kitten, delighted to be of service
to her kind friend, hurried down to the
yard, and the barn-cat took her station beside
Graywhisker’s hole. Meanwhile the
sparrow had learned from Major where
Graywhisker’s hole was situated, and was
already some distance in, when the barn-cat
took her position outside.</p>

<p>“Dark as a pocket,” said the sparrow to
himself as he cautiously groped his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps I shall see better when I’m
used to the darkness,” he said hopefully;
and he went on slowly, putting one foot
carefully before the other. Suddenly he
lost his footing and fell down several inches,
but he landed on his feet and was not
hurt.</p>

<p>“All right,” said the sparrow, and looked
about him. A little ray of light shone in
through a crevice of the wall, and he was
able to see faintly. This was evidently
Graywhisker’s dwelling; and the long dark
place he went through first, the passage-way
leading to it. As his eyes became
accustomed to the dim light he began to
distinguish objects.</p>

<p>“Whew! how close!” said the sparrow,
as he took a long breath.</p>

<p>All the old rat’s treasures were evidently
collected here. Crusts of bread, rinds of
cheese, scraps of bacon, were lying around;
and bits of rags and twine were collected in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>a corner, and evidently served as Graywhisker’s
bed.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to make your bed over to-night,
my friend,” said the sparrow, rumpling
the bed over and scattering the rags
all over the floor. “Hallo! what’s this?”
he said, as he came upon a smooth round
object.</p>

<p>“I declare, if it isn’t a hen’s egg! The
old thief! I wonder how he managed to
get it in here without breaking it! I guess
I’ll save him the trouble of breaking it;”
and he pecked at it until he had made a
hole large enough for the inside of the egg
to run out. He gave a mischievous laugh
as he saw the liquid oozing out, and then
continued his search.</p>

<p>“Whew!” he said again; “it’s getting
rather stifling here, I must hurry up.
Where in the world can that ribbon be?”
and he looked carefully around in every
direction. “Hooray!” he exclaimed, as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>caught sight of a little piece of red silk hanging
from a nail over his head. “Thought
he’d got it hid away safely, didn’t he?”
and in a twinkling he had hopped up and
caught the ribbon securely in his beak.</p>

<p>“Now for a little fresh air,” said the
sparrow; “I couldn’t stand it much
longer.”</p>

<p>He looked around for the entrance to the
passage-way. There were three holes just
alike; which was the right one? He stood
perplexed. “What a fool I was,” he said
to himself, “not to take more notice! This
is a pretty fix! Well, here goes! I’ll try
each one, and one of them <i>must</i> lead out.”
So he hopped up to the hole nearest him
and boldly entered. It was utterly dark,
and he felt his way for a time in silence;
but the sparrow, who lived out in the pure
air, was not accustomed to the close and
musty atmosphere of an old rat-hole, and
he began to feel faint and a little bewildered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
What if he shouldn’t be able to
find his way at all? But he was a brave
little fellow, and he thrust the thought aside.
“I <i>will</i> get out, I <i>won’t</i> give up,” he said
resolutely. “This hole <i>must</i> lead somewhere;”
and he pushed bravely on.</p>

<p>“Seems to me I’ve gone far enough to
take me out; I don’t understand it. My
strength won’t hold out to go back and
try another entrance.” He thought of the
bright-eyed sparrow and his three little ones,
and he determined to hold out, for they had
never seemed so dear to him as they did
now that the hope of seeing them again
appeared so small. With a great effort he
kept on, holding the bit of ribbon in his
beak. Soon he turned a sharp corner, and
with joy he beheld a ray of light in the distance.
The long dark passage led into the
main passage-way, and he was safe.</p>

<p>Just as he was about to emerge into the
daylight a faint rustle met his quick ears,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>and with horror he beheld the barn-cat
seated at the entrance.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but to wait
patiently and see what would happen next.
The air that came in through the entrance
of the hole relieved the dreadful faintness
that had so oppressed him; so he sat holding
the ribbon securely in his beak, but
with his brave little heart beating pretty
rapidly.</p>

<p>All at once a sudden noise startled him,
and peeping cautiously out he saw the barn-cat
chasing Graywhisker across the barn-floor.
Quick as a flash the sparrow was
out and had flown in safety to the window-sill,
when Graywhisker disappeared into a
hole in the wall, and the barn-cat returned
with a crestfallen air to her kittens.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> sparrow flew at once to acquaint
Mrs. Polly and the canary with the
result of his expedition. They were both
greatly relieved to see him safely back, and
rejoiced at his success. Then after a short
rest and a worm or two for lunch, he flew
merrily off to find little Nancy, carrying the
piece of red ribbon safely in his claw.</p>

<p>It was some time before he succeeded in
finding her, with her box of matches on her
arm, going about from house to house.</p>

<p>He lighted on a fence beside her, and
flaunted the red ribbon with the gold figures
on it in a very enticing manner.</p>

<p>“Why, Billy,” exclaimed the child, “how
did you get here? What a beautiful ribbon!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>I wish you would give it to me! It would
make a lovely dress for that little china doll
that hasn’t got any legs and arms, that a
little girl gave me one day.”</p>

<p>Billy waited until the child was almost
up to him, and then flew away, holding the
red ribbon securely in his claw.</p>

<p>“I know you want to put it in your nest,
Billy,” continued the child; “but any rag
would do just as well for you, and I never
saw such a <i>beautiful</i> piece of ribbon in all
my life.”</p>

<p>But Billy flew on and lighted again on a
stone in front of little Nancy.</p>

<p>The child tore off a piece of her dress,
that was in such an untidy condition that
the little piece of calico would not be
missed, and approached the sparrow cautiously,
saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I will give you this piece off my dress,
Billy, to put in your nest, if you will give
me that beautiful ribbon. This will do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>better for you, because it’s bigger. Now,
<i>do</i> give it to me, and I’ll give you and your
little mate ever so many crumbs from the
next piece of bread I get.”</p>

<p>The sparrow again waited till the child
had almost reached him, and then flew
away as before.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me!” she exclaimed sadly; “I
did want it so much!” and she turned to go
back with a weary air.</p>

<p>Then the sparrow came towards her and
dropped the ribbon on the ground. The
child ran to pick it up; but just as she
stooped to seize it, the sparrow caught it
up in his beak and flew off with it.</p>

<p>“I shall follow him,” said the child to
herself, “till I get that ribbon. I know he’ll
drop it again, for he’s a very careless fellow.”</p>

<p>So the two went on, the sparrow occasionally
dropping the ribbon and then seizing
it again as the child was about to put
her hand on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Posy and Tom were out in
the yard, or rather seated on the step of
the kitchen door, watching the barn-kittens
playing. The gray kitten played too, but
more gently than the tiger-kittens.</p>

<p>“I’m going to bring out the house-kittens,”
said Posy; “they ought to have a
good time too.”</p>

<p>The house-cat was lying in the box beside
her kittens when Posy came for them.</p>

<p>“I’m going to let your kitties play with
the barn-kitties,” said Posy in explanation
to the house-cat, who looked rather startled
at such a sudden interruption; “they ought
to be out in the fresh air instead of sleeping
in this hot kitchen. You needn’t meaw so,
for I shan’t hurt them.”</p>

<p>What the house-cat said was this,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I don’t want my kittens playing with
those rough barn-kittens; it will spoil their
manners.” But Posy didn’t understand her;
and it wouldn’t have made any difference
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>if she had, for she was very fond of the
barn-cat and approved highly of the way
she brought up her family. So Posy carried
out the kittens, followed closely by the
house-cat.</p>

<p>Posy put the kittens on the ground beside
the little tiger-kittens, and then went back
to her seat on the door-step beside Tom to
watch them play.</p>

<p>The little tiger-kittens stood still a minute
and watched the new-comers curiously.
Then they flew at each other, and clawed
each other, and rolled over together. The
barn-cat looked on, very proud of her children’s
strength; but the house-cat had a
very scornful expression on her countenance,
as she scowled at the little tiger-kittens.</p>

<p>“Come back at once!” she called to
her little Maltese kittens. “I don’t wish
you to associate with those common barn-kittens.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, do let us stay; it’s <i>such</i> fun!” they
answered piteously.</p>

<p>“Let ’em have a little frolic; it’ll do ’em
good,” said the barn-cat. “They’ll get sick
lying in that hot kitchen.”</p>

<p>“I’m very particular about their manners,”
said the house-cat; “I don’t want
them to learn common ways.”</p>

<p>“My kittens won’t teach ’em anything to
hurt their manners,” answered the barn-cat;
“let ’em stay and have a good time.
Come, my dears,” she said to the little Maltese
kittens in a motherly tone, “you play
just as much as you want to.”</p>

<p>The house-cat looked anxiously around.
None of her stylish acquaintances were in
sight, and it <i>did</i> seem a pity to cheat her
darlings out of a romp in this fresh air; so
she didn’t say they <i>shouldn’t</i> stay, and the
kittens interpreted her silence as a consent.
So they grew very cheerful, and watched
the tiger-kittens chase each other and claw
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>and roll over, till at last they became bold,
and one of them went up to one of the tiger-kittens
and gave him a gentle tap with his
paw, exactly as Posy often did to Tom
when she called out “Tag!”</p>

<p>Then the tiger-kitten turned and chased
him, and how the little Maltese kitten did
run! He dodged almost as well as the
tiger-kittens did, and the tiger-kitten had to
try with all his might till he caught the
Maltese kitten, and then they both rolled
over together and kicked and clawed, just
as if the Maltese kitten had played “tag”
every day of his life.</p>

<p>“Very well indeed, my dear!” said the
barn-cat, with an approving nod; “try it
once more, and you needn’t be afraid to
put out your claws a little farther. My
kittens don’t mind a few scratches, I can
tell you; and look here, my dear, when
you run up to them, crouch a little, this
way, and wriggle your body before you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>spring, and don’t be afraid of hurting them
when you knock them over. Try it again,
my dear; you’ll do it better next time.”</p>

<p>The little Maltese kitten did try it again,
and succeeded so well that the house-cat,
although she tried not to look interested,
couldn’t resist a smile of pride. Then the
other Maltese kitten tried it, and did it so
well that the barn-cat praised her for it.</p>

<p>“Now, my dears,” said the barn-cat,
“I’m going to teach you how to catch
mice.”</p>

<p>She looked around and picked out a little
green apple that would roll easily.</p>

<p>“Now play that was a mouse sitting
still; show me how you would catch it.
You begin first,” she said to one of her kittens,
“because you’ve already had a lesson
in it.”</p>

<p>So the tiger-kitten crept cautiously towards
the apple, swishing her little tail the
way her mother had taught her; and when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>she came within the proper distance she
stopped and wriggled her body from side to
side, and then gave a great spring and
seized the apple with her little front paws;
but the tiger-kitten was so excited from
playing “tag,” that she forgot she was playing
“mouse,” and batted the apple with her
little paws and set it rolling, and then chased
it and caught it, and lay on her back and
clawed it with all her four paws.</p>

<p>“I’m ashamed of you,” said the barn-cat
severely; “now put it down and do it over
again properly; and mind, no fooling this
time!”</p>

<p>So the little tiger-kitten did it over again,
and really did it very well; and then the
Maltese kittens tried it, and the barn-cat
was very much pleased with them. “Now,”
said the barn-cat, “we’ll make believe
’tis a mouse running. See how well you
can do that!” and she gave the apple a
push with her paw, and all the four kittens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>set off at once after it, and rolled over
one another and clawed and kicked just as
they had done when they played “tag.”</p>

<p>The barn-cat couldn’t help smiling to
herself, but she took care that the kittens
didn’t see her smile, and then she made
each one do it alone, and gave them very
good advice about hiding behind corners
and then suddenly springing out.</p>

<p>The children had been watching this play
with the greatest interest, and often laughed
aloud, when all at once Posy exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Why, there is a little girl without any
shoes and stockings on, and her’s got a
basket on her arm. What do you suppose
her wants, Tom?”</p>

<p>The little barefooted girl was Nancy,
whom the sparrow had succeeded in enticing
by means of the red ribbon with gold
figures on it. She had stood watching the
kittens play for some minutes before Posy
saw her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“She’s got something to sell, I guess,”
said Tom.</p>

<p>Just then Hannah came to the door,
and the children told her about the little
girl.</p>

<p>“Go away!” said Hannah; “we don’t
want to buy anything.”</p>

<p>The child came a step nearer and said
timidly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Will you please to buy some matches,
ma’am?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Hannah shortly; “we don’t
want any pedlers ’round here.”</p>

<p>The child sighed and turned away.</p>

<p>“Hannah,” said Posy, with her cheeks
very red, “that’s a poor little girl, and
Mamma always buys things of poor little
girls.”</p>

<p>“Your mamma’s got plenty of matches,”
said Hannah in the same cross tone. “She
wants a chance to steal something; that’s
what she wants.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>“You’re a very unkind girl, Hannah,”
said Posy angrily. “I know Mamma will
buy some matches; won’t her, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Tom decidedly. “She tells
us to be good to poor people; and this little
girl hasn’t got any shoes and stockings,
and her feet look awful sore.”</p>

<p>“Mamma!” screamed Posy, running under
the window of Mamma’s room.</p>

<p>“What is it, dear?” asked Mamma, coming
to the window.</p>

<p>“There’s a awful poor little girl here,
Mamma,” said Posy eagerly; “and her
hasn’t got any shoes and stockings, and her
has matches to sell. <i>Do</i> buy some, Mamma;
her looks so tired, and sad;” and Posy was
very near crying.</p>

<p>“Tell her to wait a minute,” said Mamma,
“and I’ll come down.”</p>

<p>So Posy and Tom ran after the little
girl and brought her back just as Mamma
appeared at the kitchen door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>“Come in, little girl,” said Mamma
kindly, “and sit down. You look tired.”</p>

<p>The child did indeed look tired, and
seated herself wearily; but the instant she
touched the chair her head fell forward on
her breast, and she would have fallen to
the floor if Hannah had not caught her in
time.</p>

<p>“Bring her into the dining-room where
it is cool,” said Mrs. Winton, “and lay her
on the sofa.”</p>

<p>So Hannah, whose heart was a good deal
kinder than her tongue, picked up the forlorn
child and gently placed her on the sofa
in the cool dining-room.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>om</span> and Posy watched little Nancy
with distressed countenances as she
lay on the lounge so still and white.</p>

<p>“Don’t be frightened,” said Mrs. Winton,
as she caught sight of their faces, that were
almost as pale as the little match-girl’s;
“she has only fainted and will be well
again in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>So Mrs. Winton bathed the child’s forehead
with cold water, and Hannah fanned
her with a palm-leaf fan.</p>

<p>“Tom,” said Mamma, “I wish you would
bring me a pitcher of cold water fresh from
the pump.” But there was no answer, and
Mamma looked around. Both of the children
were gone. Just as the little match-girl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
opened her eyes Tom appeared carrying
a pillow, and Posy brought up the rear
with a bottle of cologne in one hand and all
the playthings she could carry under the
other arm.</p>

<p>“I thought the little girl would like to
have my pillow under her head,” said Tom,
handing it to Mamma.</p>

<p>“It was very thoughtful,” answered
Mamma.</p>

<p>“And Posy brought the bottle of German
cologne she got on her birthday,” added
Tom, as Posy stood shyly behind him;
“she’s been keeping it for you when you
have a headache, but she says she wants
the little girl to have it because she didn’t
believe she ever had any nice German
cologne before.”</p>

<p>Posy felt paid for the little sacrifice she
had made when Mamma smiled at her.
Meanwhile Nancy was sitting up, looking
around her with a bewildered air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>“She probably ate something that hurt
her,” said Hannah; “there’s no telling what
these kind of people eat. A good dose of
thoroughwort would fetch her out of this.”</p>

<p>“What did you have for your breakfast,
my dear?” asked Mrs. Winton kindly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have any breakfast,” answered
the child.</p>

<p>“What did you eat for your supper last
night?” asked Mrs. Winton.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have any supper, either,” said
the little match-girl.</p>

<p>“How happened it, my child?” asked
Mrs. Winton, with a serious face.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t sell any matches, so she
didn’t give me anything to eat. She said
I didn’t earn my salt.”</p>

<p>“Who is <i>she</i>?”</p>

<p>“The woman where I live,” answered the
child.</p>

<p>“Is she your relative?” asked Mrs.
Winton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the child.</p>

<p>“Hannah,” said Mrs. Winton, “bring me
a bowl of bread and milk. It is as I suspected;
the child is half starved.”</p>

<p>Posy came around to Mamma’s side, and
leaned against her in what Hannah called
“Posy’s coaxing way.”</p>

<p>“Don’t send her back to that horrid
woman, will you, Mamma?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I will look after her, my darling, you
may be sure,” said Mamma.</p>

<p>“But you <i>will</i> let her stay, won’t you,
Mamma?” repeated Posy.</p>

<p>“I will let her stay till she feels well
again, and then I will find out about her,”
answered Mamma soothingly. “Don’t be
troubled, Posy; I love my own little children
too well not to try to make all other
children happy.”</p>

<p>Posy looked greatly relieved.</p>

<p>Tom had been silently watching the little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>match-girl, and listening eagerly to what
Mamma said to Posy. He put his hand in
his pocket and pulled out his new top and
looked lovingly at it.</p>

<p>“She can have my new top if she wants
it,” he said to Mamma.</p>

<p>“I am glad you thought of it, my dear,
but I don’t think little girls care much for
tops,” said Mamma.</p>

<p>An expression of relief came over Tom’s
face; for the new top was very dear to him,
and he had saved the money for it, cent by
cent.</p>

<p>“Do you think she would like to have
Miss Pompadour?” asked Posy.</p>

<p>“We will see that she has playthings,”
said Mamma; “but first of all she needs
food, and here comes Hannah with the
bread and milk.”</p>

<p>The poor child ate greedily, the children
looking on with intense satisfaction.</p>

<p>That afternoon Major was harnessed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>the carryall; and Mr. Winton, with Tom and
Posy, and little Nancy for a guide, set out
for Nancy’s old home. A ride was an unknown
and undreamed-of treat to the neglected
child, and the kindness with which
she was received almost overpowered her.</p>

<p>Although Nancy had lived such a joyless
life, her powers of observation were unusually
acute; and the stories she related to
Posy, who sat beside her on the back seat,
were so very novel and interesting that
Tom forgot to ask to drive, and listened as
intently as Posy did. She told them about
Billy, and the bright-eyed sparrow, and the
baby sparrows, and the little blind gray
kitten; and in this way the time passed so
very quickly that they reached their destination
before the children had heard half
enough.</p>

<p>Mr. Winton went into the house and left
the children in the carriage.</p>

<p>Nancy pointed out the little house where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>the bright-eyed sparrow lived; and there
she was at the door of the house.</p>

<p>“She’s going to teach the young birds
how to fly,” said Nancy; and the children
watched with great interest.</p>

<p>First the mother bird hopped down to the
branch below, and the little sparrows came
to the door of the house and looked down.
Their mother gave a little call, but they only
stretched their necks farther out and looked
timidly down, as if the distance seemed to
them very great. The mother bird called
again, louder and more decidedly. Then
they fluttered their little wings and hopped
up and down, but dared not venture out of
their nest. The mother bird, evidently
thinking that a little discipline was required,
hopped back and gave each one a little
peck, and actually drove them out of the
nest. Then she showed them how to fly.
She flew around in short circles, and then
back again. Soon one of the little sparrows
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>grew bold, and flew a very little way and
then came back; but he seemed very proud
of what he had done and tried it over
again many times. Then, encouraged by
his example, the other two ventured out;
and they too grew quite brave, and flew
better every time they tried.</p>

<p>By this time the door of the house
opened, and Mr. Winton appeared, followed
by a woman, at sight of whom little Nancy
shrank back in the carriage and looked
frightened.</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” said Tom; “if she
comes here I’ll give her a good hit and
send her off howling.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” said Posy; “we shan’t let
her touch you.”</p>

<p>“If you take the child you take her for
good and all. I ain’t a going to take her
back when you’ve got sick of your bargain,”
they heard the woman say, as she
held the door open with one hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>“I take her for good and all,” answered
Mr. Winton, as he turned from the door and
came towards the carriage.</p>

<p>“Nancy,” he said, when they had driven
a few minutes in silence, “how should you
like to stay with us?”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Posy, clapping her hands
and jumping up and down with joy, “I
thought it would end so, you dear, good,
kind Papa!” and Posy threw her arms
around Papa’s neck, and hugged him till
she knocked off his hat and nearly fell out
of the carriage herself.</p>

<p>“I should like it very much indeed,” said
Nancy, with a gleam of happiness in her
dark eyes.</p>

<p>So little Nancy went to her new home,
and a cot-bed was put in Hannah’s room
for her.</p>

<p>“Hannah’s awful cross,” said Tom to
Nancy.</p>

<p>“But her’s good, Tom,” said Posy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>“‘Her bark’s worse than her bite,’ Papa
says.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile old Graywhisker was almost
beside himself with rage at the overthrow
of his hopes. When he escaped from the
barn-cat, he disappeared down the private
entrance to the barn and remained there
quietly until he was sure the barn-cat was
out of the way. Then he crept cautiously
out and ran to his own hole.</p>

<p>When he emerged from the long, dark
passage-way into his living-room, imagine
the confusion that met his eyes! His bed
torn to pieces and scattered all around, and
his precious hen’s egg that he had transported
with so much care and difficulty,
broken! He gave a quick glance up at
the nail where he had hung the red ribbon
with the gold figures on it. It was
empty.</p>

<p>“Gone!” he shrieked. “Stolen! but
I’ll be revenged! This will be the dearest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>piece of mischief you ever did, my dear
barn-cat! I’d give a good deal to know
who was the cat’s paw this time;” and his
shrewd old eyes peered keenly about for
some traces left by the thief. “Aha!” he
said, with an ugly grin that showed the
broken tooth in front; and he sat on his
haunches and held up a little gray feather.
“It was you, was it, my dear little cock-sparrow?
The barn-cat sent you in, did
she, to get the chestnuts out of the fire for
her? I wonder, my dear friends, if before
very long you’ll wish you had left the
little ribbon alone! The old rat will be
one too many for you, my dear creatures, I
am afraid!”</p>

<p>In this way Graywhisker gave vent to his
rage and disappointment, and sat a long
time considering how to take his revenge.
Then he decided to hold a midnight meeting
in his house, where there was no danger
of being disturbed; and the meeting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>was very fully attended, and the result kept
strictly private.</p>

<p>The next afternoon the little gray kitten
was seated in front of the barn washing herself,
when her attention was attracted by a
little mouse that ran in front of her. The
gray kitten could not see very well, and she
seldom succeeded in catching anything; but
this little mouse ran so very near that she
couldn’t help seeing it, and she quickly ran
after it.</p>

<p>The mouse ran into the barn and up the
stairs, followed very closely by the gray
kitten, and then disappeared into a large
hole under the mow. The gray kitten was
not very large herself, and the hole was so
big that she followed the little mouse in.
There was a much smaller hole at the other
end; and out of that the mouse ran, but it
was too small for the gray kitten to follow
and she turned to go back. What was her
surprise and terror to find the entrance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>closed up with a pile of hay, and that she
was a prisoner!</p>

<p>“I understand now,” said the poor little
gray kitten to herself, “why that mouse ran
so near me. It was done to get me into
this trap, and that Graywhisker was at the
bottom of it.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">G</span>reat</span> was the excitement among the
animals when they learned that the
little gray kitten was missing.</p>

<p>“She never in this world went off of
her own accord,” said the barn-cat to Mrs.
Polly; “she always stayed at home and
took care of my kittens while I was out
hunting. Something has happened to her.
We shall never see the dear little thing
again, you may be sure;” and the barn-cat
gave a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so discouraged,” said the
canary hopefully; “all of our plans have
gone well so far, and I know this will.
It’s always darkest before daylight, you
know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>“What do you propose to do about it,
pray?” asked the barn-cat in an irritable
tone. “It’s all very well to say ‘Don’t be
discouraged,’ but what is to be done? Sitting
here and talking about it won’t bring
the gray kitten back. Come, let’s have
your ideas on the subject. I’m not too old
to learn, if I <i>have</i> brought up half a dozen
families.”</p>

<p>“I don’t pretend to know myself the best
course to pursue,” answered the canary
good-naturedly, “and I shouldn’t presume
to dictate to you who have had so much
more experience than I have. I only meant
to say that Mrs. Polly, who has the wisest
head of any of us, could probably advise us
what to do.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly gave a satisfied “Ahem!” for
it always put her in a good humor to be
looked up to.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” said the barn-cat,
appeased by the canary’s good-nature.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>“Come, Mrs. Polly, I hope you will give
us your views on the subject; I know you
have been thinking it over.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Polly in an impressive
manner, “I have been considering the case,
and have come to the conclusion that the
only way to accomplish anything is to investigate
the case in a thorough manner.
Call the animals together, and I will interview
them, and discover, if possible, if they
can throw any light on this painful affair.”</p>

<p>“Capital!” exclaimed the barn-cat, “I
will attend to it at once. If you’ve no objection,
ma’am, I should like to bring my
kittens; they are old enough to begin to
learn how such matters are conducted, and
I like to have them get all the information
they can.”</p>

<p>“Very sensible indeed,” answered Mrs.
Polly; “bring them by all means, and tell
the house-cat to bring hers. Please notify
the sparrow also of the meeting; and as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>Major can’t be present you will have to
take his affidavit. That is,” explained Mrs.
Polly, seeing a puzzled look on the barn-cat’s
face, “he must tell you what he knows
about the matter, and you can report it
to me.”</p>

<p>“That’s very easy,” answered the barn-cat.
“Finding the sparrow won’t be quite
so easy. He’s never around when he’s
wanted.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is, my darling,” answered a
voice from the flowering currant; “he can’t
tear himself away from you long;” and
there sat the sparrow, swinging on a slender
branch, and looking as impudent and
careless as ever.</p>

<p>“Well, you <i>are</i> here when you’re wanted
for once in your life,” said the barn-cat.
“See if you can keep still in one place till
we’re ready for the meeting;” and off went
the barn-cat on her errand.</p>

<p>In a short time the house-cat appeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>with her kittens nicely washed, and looking
as pretty and fresh as possible, and soon
after the barn-cat appeared with <i>her</i> kittens.
She had had time to wash them carefully,
as Major was out and she could not have
the desired interview with him. Their little
tiger-skins were glossy, and they looked
as if it were hard work for them to walk
sedately behind their mother.</p>

<p>The house-cat was seated with her kittens
beside her, and the barn-cat took up
her position at a distance and placed her
kittens where she could keep an eye on
them. While she was making their toilets
she had given them so many instructions
in regard to their behavior, that they presented
a very demure appearance, although
their little bright eyes danced about in such
a very animated way that it seemed probable
that it wouldn’t be a very difficult task
to make them forget their dignity.</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly looked as wise as half a dozen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>judges put together, wigs and all. She
looked silently around on the little group
collected about her and then gave a little
cough, as was usual when she had something
of importance to say.</p>

<p>“I suppose you all understand why this
meeting was called,” she began. “The
little gray kitten, of whom we are all so
fond, is missing, and we are trying to discover
some traces of her. Now, to proceed
in a systematic manner, the first point to
find out is, who saw her last, and where?”</p>

<p>There was a moment’s silence, and then
one of the little house-kittens said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I think old Graywhisker has eaten the
gray kitten up.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?” asked Mrs.
Polly quickly.</p>

<p>“Because he’s got such long, sharp teeth.
My mother says he’d eat me up quicker
than a wink if he caught me,” answered the
house-kitten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“When did you see the gray kitten last,
my dear?” asked Mrs. Polly.</p>

<p>“Not for a very long time,” replied the
little house-kitten. “My mother says she’s
common, and doesn’t like to have us play
with her.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you’ve no information to give
on the subject,” said Mrs. Polly severely,
“don’t give it. You must learn to be seen
and not heard.”</p>

<p>The little house-kitten was somewhat
abashed at this reproof; but her embarrassment
did not last long, for her sister,
the other house-kitten, who was tired of
sitting still so long, moved her tail backward
and forward in such a very enticing
manner that she couldn’t resist the temptation
of springing at it and clawing it.</p>

<p>The house-cat was rather ashamed of her
want of discipline, particularly as the barn-kittens
sat all this time in a dignified manner,
with their small tails straight out behind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>them; and more especially as the barn-cat’s
face wore a very self-satisfied smile,
as if she were enjoying the house-cat’s
discomfiture.</p>

<p>“If you don’t sit still I shall take you
home at once,” she said to the house-kittens
when she had restored order and placed
them where she could reach them in case
of a second disturbance.</p>

<p>“Now that order is restored,” said Mrs.
Polly, “we will proceed to business. When
did <i>you</i> see the gray kitten last?” she asked
the sparrow.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen her for the last two
days,” answered the sparrow. “She isn’t
so attached to me as my friend the barn-cat
here, and doesn’t follow me up so closely.”</p>

<p>“Don’t joke at such a serious moment,”
said the barn-cat crossly.</p>

<p>“It’s as easy to laugh as to cry,” answered
the sparrow, “and a good deal
pleasanter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span></p>

<p>“Our friend the sparrow did us such a
good turn in recovering the stolen ribbon,”
said Mrs. Polly, “that we mustn’t be too
hard on his peculiarities. We all know
that if his manner is sometimes frivolous,
he has proved to us that he has a warm
heart and is devoted to our service.”</p>

<p>“His heart’s warm enough and he is
brave enough too,” said the barn-cat, who
had a strong sense of justice; “but I
<i>do</i> wish he was a little steadier in his
ways.”</p>

<p>“We must take people as we find them,”
answered Mrs. Polly. “Now, Mrs. Barn-cat,
when did <i>you</i> see the gray kitten
last?”</p>

<p>“I left her yesterday afternoon to watch
my kittens while I was out, and when I
came back she was gone. That’s all I
know about it.”</p>

<p>The little tiger-kittens had listened to
every word that had been said, and had a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>very important air, as if they could tell
something if they were asked. Mrs. Polly’s
keen eyes noticed this, and she said to one
of them,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now, my dear, I want you to tell me
just what happened while your mother was
away yesterday afternoon. Don’t be afraid
to speak out.”</p>

<p>The kitten evidently was <i>not</i> afraid to
speak out, and began in a clear voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>“We had a fine play, and the gray kitten
couldn’t catch us because we dodged so.
We caught her every time.”</p>

<p>“What’s that to do with the subject, I
should like to know?” asked the house-cat
severely, for she remembered how her kitten
had been snubbed; “and anybody
could see with half an eye that my kitten
is much smarter than that stupid-looking
thing,” she added to herself.</p>

<p>“Please don’t confuse the witness,” said
Mrs. Polly to the house-cat. “Very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>well, my dear,” she continued, turning
to the little tiger-kitten; “what happened
next?”</p>

<p>“We played till we got tired, and that’s
all,” answered the little tiger-kitten.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” exclaimed the house-cat
triumphantly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly scowled fiercely at her,
and then turned to the little tiger-kitten
again.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear, and what happened after
you became tired of playing?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the little kitten, as she
kept her eye on one of the house-kittens
who was rolling a pebble with her soft paw,
“then a little mouse ran by.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Mrs. Polly; “and what then,
my dear? What did you do when the little
mouse ran by?”</p>

<p>“We wanted to catch it, but the gray kitten
wouldn’t let us. She said our mother
told her not to let us go away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>“And what did the gray kitten do then?”
asked Mrs. Polly quickly.</p>

<p>“She ran after the little mouse and she
didn’t come back again, and that’s all,”
said the little tiger-kitten.</p>

<p>“Very good indeed, my dear,” answered
Mrs. Polly, with an approving nod of her
head. “You’ve told a very connected
story, and we’ve found out that the gray
kitten chased a mouse and has not been
seen since.”</p>

<p>The barn-cat was intensely gratified at
her kitten’s sagacity, but the only expression
she gave to her satisfaction was to
wash the little tiger-kitten’s face affectionately.
Then she said, after a few moments’
silence,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Before we break up, I should like to
mention that the collar that Posy gave me
has disappeared. It was quite loose for
me, and I <i>may</i> have lost it when I was
off hunting. I don’t like to accuse anybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
wrongly, but it was a very handsome
affair, and I dare say created a
good deal of jealousy among my acquaintances;”
and she looked very hard at the
house-cat.</p>

<p>“If you mean <i>me</i>,” said the house-cat,
with a toss of her head, “let me tell you
that <i>I</i> haven’t stolen your old collar. <i>I</i>
don’t need collars to make me look respectable,
thank goodness!”</p>

<p>“Very true,” answered the barn-cat; “it
would take more than <i>collars</i> to make some
people look respectable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, come,” said Mrs. Polly,
“don’t get personal! I have no doubt that
old Graywhisker knows where that collar
is, just as well as he knows where the gray
kitten is.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!” exclaimed the
sparrow.</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” said Mrs. Polly decidedly.
“I believe that Graywhisker sent that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>mouse to entice the half-blind gray kitten,
and that he’s got her safely hidden somewhere,
for he wouldn’t dare really to let
her come to any harm.”</p>

<p>“How can we find her?” asked the barn-cat.</p>

<p>“All of you keep your ears open and
perhaps you’ll pick up some news. If we
find out where she is, the children can probably
rescue her. They’ll soon notice that
she is missing and hunt for her.”</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“W</span>e’re</span> going to play ‘circus’ in the
barn this afternoon,” said Posy at
dinner, “and we’re going to have the
kittens for the animals.”</p>

<p>“Nancy plays circus first-class,” said
Tom; “she isn’t such a scare-cat as most
girls are.”</p>

<p>“Where did she learn anything about the
circus?” asked Papa. “I don’t believe she
ever saw anything but the tents.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Posy eagerly; “her
says when the circus was here once her
skun the fence and peeked through a hole
under the tent and her saw the horses’
feet.”</p>

<p>“Poor child!” said Papa, “the next time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>the circus comes she shan’t ‘skin’ the fence,
but shall go with you and see the whole
performance.”</p>

<p>“Hannah,” said Posy after dinner, “have
you seen anything of the barn-cat’s collar?
Her has lost it.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Hannah, “I haven’t
seen it, and what’s more I don’t expect
to. I guess it won’t be the last thing that
you’ll find missing. You’d better look
after your things a little sharper, for I don’t
trust that Nancy too fur.”</p>

<p>“Nancy is a good little girl, Hannah.
Her doesn’t steal. It’s very mean to say
such things,” said Posy angrily.</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t do no harm to keep your
things locked up,” replied Hannah.</p>

<p>Nancy came in from the barn, where she
had been to feed the kittens.</p>

<p>“I can’t find the gray kitten anywhere,”
she said, looking very much distressed. “I’ve
hunted and called, but she doesn’t answer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps the rats have carried her off,”
said Posy, with a troubled air.</p>

<p>“I guess she’s gone to hunt for mice,”
suggested Tom, who appeared at that moment.
“She won’t run off. Let’s go and
play ‘circus’ in the barn-chamber. You
bring the house-kittens, Posy, and I’ll get
the barn-kittens.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t mew so loud,” said Posy
to the house-cat as she took up the kittens.
“I won’t hurt your babies, and I’ll bring
’em back all safe. They are going to be
teached to play circus.”</p>

<p>The house-cat was not at all afraid to
trust her kittens with Posy. What she said
was: “I don’t like this way of snatching up
my kittens and carrying ’em off to play
with those barn-kittens. I expect they’ll
get to be just as common as they are, if this
isn’t put a stop to.”</p>

<p>The kittens themselves, however, had no
such fears, and were delighted at the prospect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
of a play with the lively barn-kittens;
for it was not very entertaining to lie in the
box by the kitchen stove, and Hannah always
drove them back if they ventured out
of it when the children were not there.
So when Posy dumped them on the barn-floor
by the side of the tiger-kittens, they
began to play in earnest.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a tiger-hunt,” said Tom,
after watching the kittens at their play;
“and the barn-kittens can be the tigers,
and the house-kittens can be our hunting-dogs.”</p>

<p>“Oh, splendid!” cried Posy, clapping
her hands and jumping up and down.</p>

<p>“First, we’ll make a cave,” said Tom,
“because tigers live in caves, you know;”
and he began to dig a cave in the side of
the hay-mow. Nancy entered into the work
with great zest, and soon a fine cave was
finished and the tigers were placed in it.</p>

<p>“What fun it would be if they could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>understand what we said to them!” said
Nancy. “I used to think that Billy understood
what I told him, he always seemed
so sorry when I told him how hungry and
tired I was.”</p>

<p>“Mamma says that animals know more
than we think they do,” said Tom.</p>

<p>It really did seem as if the tiger-kittens
knew what was expected of them; for they
stayed quite still in the cave, crouching
down in the dark, and the little house-kittens
sat down and looked up at Tom
while he explained the game, just as if they
understood every word he said.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Tom, “we’ll be the hunters
and we’ll go out hunting for tigers,
and the dogs will run about searching for
game, and then we’ll discover the cave
and send ’em in to drive the tigers out.”</p>

<p>“I should think really and truly tigers
would eat the dogs up,” said Nancy, who
had a very practical mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>Tom looked somewhat crestfallen at this
view of the question, but Posy said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“We’ll <i>play</i> these were good, kind tigers,
and didn’t hurt anybody, won’t we?”</p>

<p>So it was agreed that these tigers were
exceptional tigers, and the hunting-party
started out in search of game.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” cried Posy suddenly, “I
saw a great ugly rat run across there.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t have been a rat,” said
Tom. “They don’t dare to come out here;
they’re afraid of the barn-cat.”</p>

<p>“It <i>was</i> a rat,” persisted Posy; “I know
it was. It had a great long tail, and it had
long yellow teeth, and one of them was
broken off. I do wish the barn-cat were
here.”</p>

<p>“No matter,” said Nancy, who was eager
to continue the tiger-hunt; “he’s gone now,
and I don’t believe he’ll come back.”</p>

<p>So the hunting-party started once more,
and the dogs kept ahead, just exactly as if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>they had understood what Tom said about
the game; and soon they came to the cave,
and went up to it and looked in.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Tom, “the dogs have
scented game;” and the party stood still.</p>

<p>“Go in and drive ’em out!” said Tom to
the dogs; and in they went, and soon out
came the tigers followed by the dogs. The
tigers ran a short distance and then turned
and faced the dogs, and the dogs pounced
on them, and they rolled over and over till
the children laughed so heartily they were
obliged to sit down.</p>

<p>Soon one of the tigers jumped up and ran
off, and one of the dogs chased him into a
corner, and then the tiger did something
very unexpected. All at once he stopped
and put his head on one side as if he were
listening to something, and then he gave a
little mew, and both he and the hunting-dog
began pulling the hay away with their
claws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“They hear a mouse, I do believe,” said
Tom.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t dig the hay away like
that for a mouse,” said Nancy; “they’d sit
still and watch till it came out.”</p>

<p>“What can it be?” said the children,
looking at each other in surprise, for the
other two kittens had joined them, and all
four were evidently in a state of great
excitement.</p>

<p>“Let’s help ’em,” said Nancy; and she at
once began pulling the hay away in large
handfuls. Soon she heard a faint “meaw!”
from beneath the hay, and she kept on digging
till at last out walked the little gray
kitten!</p>

<p>“You dear thing!” cried Posy, catching
her up in her arms and hugging her.
“How did you get in there? Her must
have some milk right straight off, Nancy.”</p>

<p>Tom and Nancy followed Posy into the
kitchen; and the barn-cat, who had just
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>returned from a hunting expedition of her
own, followed too, and jumped on the
window-sill of the kitchen that she might
see what went on without being driven
away by the house-cat or Hannah.</p>

<p>The little gray kitten was soon drinking
her saucer of milk contentedly, while the
children stood around as happy as she herself
was; but not one of them was more
gratified than the barn-cat, who was so fond
of her little <i>protégé</i>.</p>

<p>“Why, where has my necklace gone,”
said Posy suddenly, putting her hand up
to her neck,&mdash;“my pretty amber necklace
that Uncle Tom gave me?”</p>

<p>“You must have dropped it in the barn
while we were playing,” said Nancy; “I’ll
run back and look.”</p>

<p>After a few minutes Nancy came back,
walking slowly and with a disappointed expression
on her face. “I’ve looked everywhere,”
she said, “but I can’t find it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t suppose you would find it,”
said Hannah dryly. “I guess you’ve seen
the last of your necklace, Posy; it’s gone
to find the cat’s collar, I guess. Come,”
she continued, turning to Nancy, “you just
understand that this won’t do here.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” stammered
poor Nancy, looking pale and frightened.</p>

<p>“Yes, you do understand well enough,”
said Hannah. “You just hand over that
necklace and that cat’s collar, or there’ll be
trouble, I can tell you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where they are,” said
Nancy, trembling. “I haven’t touched
them. The necklace was on Posy’s neck
when we were playing in the barn.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that,” answered Hannah;
“and you may as well own up first as last.
Come, hand it over;” and she laid her
hand on Nancy’s shoulder and gave her a
shake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t know where it is,” cried
Nancy, bursting into tears; “<i>do</i> believe
me!”</p>

<p>“She <i>didn’t</i> steal it,” said Tom stoutly;
“I know she didn’t! Here, you just let
her alone, old Hannah!”</p>

<p>“Hannah,” said Posy, stamping her little
foot, “you’re a bad, bad girl, and I don’t
love you one bit!” and Posy too burst into
tears of excitement.</p>

<p>“We’ll see who is the bad one before
long,” said Hannah calmly.</p>

<p>“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,”
said Tom fiercely, and almost ready to cry
with Nancy and Posy.</p>

<p>“Why, what’s all this?” said Mamma,
coming into the kitchen. “What has happened?”
and she looked in surprise from
one to the other of the excited group.</p>

<p>“Posy’s necklace has disappeared, and I
said I thought Nancy took it, and I say so
now,” said Hannah decidedly.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“N</span>ancy</span> <i>didn’t</i> steal my necklace, I
<i>know</i> her didn’t,” said Posy.</p>

<p>“Of course she didn’t,” said Tom; “it
must have dropped off while we were playing
tiger.”</p>

<p>“Then why isn’t it there?” asked Hannah
triumphantly; “it couldn’t have run
away by itself, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Why do you accuse Nancy of taking it,
Hannah?” asked Mrs. Winton.</p>

<p>“Because it isn’t the first thing that has
disappeared since she came here. My silver
thimble is missing too. I had it yesterday
when I was sitting in the porch
sewing.”</p>

<p>“But it is very wrong to accuse anybody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>unless you have proof of his guilt,” said
Mrs. Winton.</p>

<p>“Oh, do <i>please</i> believe me, ma’am!” said
Nancy, with the tears running down her
cheeks and a most distressed look in her
face. “How could I be so mean as to steal
from people who have been so kind to me,&mdash;and
from dear little Posy too! Oh, do
<i>please</i> believe me!”</p>

<p>“I <i>will</i> believe you, Nancy,” said Mrs.
Winton kindly. “Now stop crying, and
remember that we will be your friends as
long as you are a good little girl. Run out
to play, children, and perhaps you will find
the necklace.”</p>

<p>So Nancy dried her tears and was tenderly
conducted out of doors by Tom and
Posy on either side; and they proved such
good comforters that in a short time she
was laughing heartily.</p>

<p>“Now, Hannah,” said Mrs. Winton, when
the children were gone, “I want you to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>give up the thought that Nancy is a thief.
She is a poor, neglected child, and I should
think that all your sympathies would go
out towards her.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in her honesty,” replied
Hannah, unmoved. “I made up my mind
she was a thief the first time I sot eyes on
her.”</p>

<p>“First impressions are not to be trusted,”
said Mrs. Winton. “I shall believe the child
honest until I have reason to doubt her, and
certainly there has been nothing to prove
her guilt yet.”</p>

<p>Hannah didn’t dare say more, but she
secretly resolved to watch the child closely.</p>

<p>The barn-cat, sitting on the window-sill,
had heard the whole conversation, and so
had the little gray kitten; and the barn-cat
reported it faithfully to Mrs. Polly, who
was greatly troubled by it. “I’ll think it
over and see if I can find any way to prove
Nancy’s innocence,” she said. “‘Give a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>dog a bad name and it will stick to him,’
is a very true saying, and we must clear
this poor child’s reputation, or by-and-by
others besides Hannah will begin to suspect
her. Yes, I’ll think the matter over carefully
and see what can be done. The sparrow
moves his family over here to-day, and
I am very glad of it. I am in hopes he
will turn over a new leaf and stay at home
more in the future.”</p>

<p>“Seeing is believing,” said the barn-cat
dryly; “I haven’t much hope of him
myself.”</p>

<p>It was true that the sparrow was about to
move. Mrs. Polly’s sharp eyes had discovered
a deserted swallow’s nest just under
the roof of the piazza, in a position where
she could watch what went on; and she
proposed that he should put it in order for
his family. The plan pleased the sparrow,
and he at once set to work to build. He
brought bits of straw and twine and hair,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>in fact anything he could find, and put it
inside the swallow’s nest. He was a careless
fellow, and didn’t spend any more time
than was necessary over the building; but
when it was finished it was quite a nice
little house,&mdash;a great improvement, certainly,
on the house in the elm-tree that his
family now occupied.</p>

<p>The next day the sparrow appeared, escorting
his bright-eyed wife and her three
little ones, now fine strong young birds;
and they seemed much pleased with their
new quarters.</p>

<p>“That bright-eyed Mrs. Sparrow is a
nice little thing,” said Mrs. Polly to herself,
“much too nice to be neglected by
that scamp of a husband of hers. I’ll keep
a sharp lookout, and set matters straight if
he goes on in the old way.”</p>

<p>The sparrow was very attentive to his
family the first day, and brought the finest
worms and insects he could find for them to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>eat, and busied himself for their comfort in
many ways, and the bright-eyed sparrow
looked very happy; but when twilight
came on the sparrow became a little restless
and nervous, as if he had something on his
mind. Mrs. Polly’s shrewd eyes noticed
all this, and she said to herself,&mdash;</p>

<p>“It’s just as I thought; but I <i>did</i> think
he’d have sense enough to stay at home
the first night. It’s much worse than I
thought.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, my dear,” said the sparrow,
coming up to his bright-eyed wife and giving
her a hasty kiss; “I’ll be in as early
as I can.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you’re going to
leave me the very first night after we’ve
been separated so long, and in a strange
place too?” said the bright-eyed sparrow
indignantly.</p>

<p>“Only for a short time, my dear. It’s
an engagement I made some time ago.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>Very sorry, upon my honor; but I must
keep my word!”</p>

<p>“How <i>can</i> you treat me so?” said the
bright-eyed sparrow. “You ought to be
ashamed of yourself. I’ll go back to-morrow,
and never live with you any more!”</p>

<p>The sparrow considered a moment. He
<i>was</i> a good-natured fellow in spite of his
roving propensities. He looked at the
bright-eyed sparrow; she was crying, and
he couldn’t leave her feeling so unhappy.
He went up to her and said in a very
tender tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>“See here, my dear! don’t you know that
you’re going to work the wrong way? I
am the easiest fellow to manage you ever
saw if you know how to take me.”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew the way to take you,”
answered the bright-eyed sparrow; “I’d
take it fast enough. <i>I</i> manage <i>you</i>, indeed!”
and she gave a scornful little laugh.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear that you could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>catch more flies with molasses than with
vinegar?” said the sparrow. “Well, my
dear, I am willing to be caught with molasses,
but clip my pinions if you’ll catch
<i>me</i> with vinegar! Come, my dear,” he said
very gently and putting his little head close
to hers, “if you want me to stay at home
tell me that you care a little for me, and
make me feel good, instead of telling me
what a worthless fellow I am.”</p>

<p>“Will you really and truly stay?” said
the bright-eyed sparrow, smiling through
her tears.</p>

<p>“Really and truly,” answered the sparrow
tenderly.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll think you are the dearest and
best husband in the whole world,” answered
the bright-eyed sparrow; and she reached
up her little beak and gave him a hearty
kiss.</p>

<p>“That’s as it should be,” said Mrs. Polly
to herself, with her nod of satisfaction, “but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>it won’t last long. He’ll be trying it over
again soon, and they’ll not always make
up so easy. I <i>do</i> wish he had firmer
principles!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly was right. It <i>was</i> not very
long before there was trouble again in the
sparrow’s household. One afternoon the
bright-eyed sparrow looked very anxious.
She flew backward and forward, and perched
on the top of the tallest trees and looked
about in every direction, and then she
flew home again and peered out of her
little house with a very distressed expression.</p>

<p>“I know what it all means,” said Mrs.
Polly; “that scamp of a husband of hers
is off again. I must give him a talking to.
He ought to set a better example to his
young family.”</p>

<p>“Good-evening, my dear,” she called to
the bright-eyed sparrow, who was just then
looking out of her house; “hasn’t your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>husband come home yet? He ought to be
in by this time.”</p>

<p>“Oh! he’ll come soon, I dare say,” answered
the bright-eyed sparrow cheerfully;
“he’s probably been detained by business.”</p>

<p>“Don’t feel anxious, my dear,” said Mrs.
Polly; “nothing will happen to him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not at all anxious,” said the
bright-eyed sparrow, with a great attempt
at cheerfulness; but her voice was not as
hopeful as her words, and it had a sad tone
that quite touched Mrs. Polly.</p>

<p>“He’s been away all day long,” whispered
the canary to Mrs. Polly; “I saw him
go off early this morning, and if she sees
him before to-morrow morning it’s more
than I think she will.”</p>

<p>“I declare it is too bad, too bad!”
said Mrs. Polly, shaking her head gravely.</p>

<p>The canary was right. Just before daybreak
the next morning they heard the
sparrow come home; and although the dining-room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
window was closed, they knew
from the sounds that reached them that the
sparrows had a quarrel. Mrs. Polly waited
until the sparrow was awake,&mdash;for he slept
late after his dissipation, and it was afternoon
before he was fully awake,&mdash;and
then she called to them that she had something
to say to them.</p>

<p>Both of the birds flew down and seated
themselves on the flowering-currant bush
before the dining-room window, where Mrs.
Polly could converse easily with them.</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">M</span>rs. Polly</span> looked seriously from
the sparrow, who sat pluming his ruffled
feathers, to his little wife, who looked
as fresh and bright-eyed as ever.</p>

<p>“I want to have a little talk with you,”
began Mrs. Polly in a serious tone, “and I
take it that this is as good a time as any.”</p>

<p>“Delighted, I’m sure,” said the sparrow
indifferently, as he continued his toilet.</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed,” said Mrs. Polly severely,
for she was not pleased with the sparrow’s
frivolous manner, “that you neglect your
family a good deal. I’ve seen more than
you are aware of.”</p>

<p>“Flattered, I’m sure, by the attention,”
replied the sparrow, carefully picking out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>a particularly rough feather and drawing
his beak through it.</p>

<p>“My friend,” said Mrs. Polly in the same
serious tone, “you won’t deter me from
doing my duty by such frivolous remarks.
I have lived in the world long enough to
see many generations of sparrows come and
go, and I shall <i>not</i> see a young couple beginning
life start out on such a mistaken
course as you have chosen, without making
an attempt to set them right. Pray, what
were you married for, I should like to
know?”</p>

<p>The sparrow considered a moment and
then said waggishly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Give it up.”</p>

<p>“I can tell you,” answered Mrs. Polly.
“You saw that pretty bright-eyed sparrow,
and you made her think there never was
such a handsome, wonderful fellow as you
were, and you married her without a
thought of the future. It never occurred
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>to you that you must take care of her and
protect her. She has done her part, and
has been a faithful mother to your children;
but how have you done yours? Flying
around here and there, flirting with this one
and rollicking with that one. I know your
ways. Your family would have starved
long ago if it had not been for your little
wife there.”</p>

<p>“He has been a very good husband indeed,”
said the bright-eyed sparrow warmly.
“I have nothing to complain of.”</p>

<p>“It is very loving of you to defend your
husband, my dear, but he doesn’t really
deserve it. I saw you, last evening, looking
out for him so anxiously, and I heard
him, too, come home this morning just
before daybreak, and I knew you had
words about it. You make up, I know,
and are very affectionate until the next outbreak
occurs; but you may take my word
for it that every quarrel you have weakens
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>the love you bear each other, and by-and-by
there will be no makings up, and a feeling
of bitterness will take the place of the
love you now have for each other.”</p>

<p>Both her listeners were silent, as Mrs.
Polly paused for a moment and looked seriously
at them; then she continued,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have seen many young couples begin
as you have begun and grow apart from
each other; but I take too much interest in
you, my friends, to see you go wrong without
a word of warning. Think of your
young family and the responsibility of setting
a good example to them; their young
eyes are keener than you think they are.”</p>

<p>The sparrow had thrown aside his indifferent
manner, and listened attentively to
the last part of Mrs. Polly’s remarks; and
as she concluded, he hopped on the bough
beside the bright-eyed sparrow and nestled
affectionately against her.</p>

<p>“You are right,” he said; “I am a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>worthless vagabond, and don’t deserve such
a good little wife as I’ve got; but with
all your wisdom, Mrs. Polly, haven’t you
learned that you can’t teach an old dog
new tricks?”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Mrs. Polly decidedly;
“the idea of a bright young fellow like you
talking in that style! You’ve got sense
enough, and you’re good-hearted and brave;
now don’t throw away all those good qualities,
but use them to make of yourself a
useful member of society.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be shot if I don’t try,” said the
sparrow, with an affectionate glance at the
bright-eyed sparrow; and judging from
the manner in which she nestled against
him, it was very evident to Mrs. Polly that
there was plenty of love left.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Graywhisker sat in his hole,
laying plans for the future.</p>

<p>“It’s provoking,” he said to himself,
“that they found the gray kitten so soon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>However, I caused them some trouble, and
it couldn’t have been very pleasant for
her to be penned up over night in the
hay without food; there’s some comfort in
that. Then I’ve got Posy’s amber necklace
all safe. She didn’t think the ‘great
ugly rat’ that frightened her so when she
was playing in the barn knew enough to
pick it up when it dropped off. Well,
that’s encouraging too; and then Hannah’s
thimble,&mdash;here it is, safe and sound, and here
it will stay; and then, my dear Mrs. Barn-cat,
here’s your fine collar that you were
so fond of. You were in such an excited
state of mind when you lost it off that you
didn’t know it had gone. Here it is, and
here it will remain too. I should like to
see you venture in here again, my fine
young cock-sparrow; you wouldn’t get off
quite so easily the next time, I can tell you.
I shan’t go out again without leaving somebody
here on guard. Hallo! who’s that?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>he exclaimed, as his quick ears caught a
faint sound. “Oh, I know your light step,
Mrs. Silverskin; come in.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Silverskin appeared in her usual
timid manner. “I have heard something
I thought you would be pleased to know,”
she said in her little weak voice. “I was
hiding behind the kitchen door yesterday,
where I picked up a few crumbs the children
had dropped from their lunch, and I
heard Hannah tell Mrs. Winton that Nancy
was a thief, and had stolen Posy’s amber
necklace and Hannah’s silver thimble and
the cat’s collar.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed Graywhisker, with
a disagreeable chuckle that displayed his
broken front tooth very unpleasantly;
“nothing could be better! and what did
Mrs. Winton say?”</p>

<p>“She said she didn’t believe it,&mdash;that
she should believe her innocent until she
had proof of her guilt.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>“She <i>shall</i> have proof of it,” said the
old rat maliciously, “and before long
too.”</p>

<p>“How so?” asked Mrs. Silverskin.</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to bring that about,”
replied Graywhisker. “Don’t you see that if
Hannah’s thimble is hidden among Nancy’s
things it will be sufficient proof of her
guilt?”</p>

<p>“But who will put it there?” asked
Mrs. Silverskin, who had a secret misgiving
that the task would fall upon her.</p>

<p>“You!” said Graywhisker; “haven’t
I done favors enough for you?”</p>

<p>“I came very near being caught by the
house-cat when I stole Hannah’s thimble,”
said poor Mrs. Silverskin, “and I am afraid
to go there so often.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Madam, then you can take
the consequences,” replied Graywhisker
fiercely.</p>

<p>“I suppose I must,” answered the little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>mouse sadly; “but if anything happens to
me I hope you will see that my family are
provided for.”</p>

<p>“You need have no fears for them,”
answered Graywhisker. “To-night, when
all is still, you take the thimble and hide it
among some of Nancy’s things in her chamber.
Hannah will find it before long, and
then we’ll see how long they will believe
Nancy innocent.”</p>

<p>A little later the sparrow was flying by
Major, who was hitched to a post in the
yard, ready to go to the depot for Mr.
Winton, when he neighed to him to stop.</p>

<p>“Come here a minute and sit near me
while I tell you something very important,”
he said.</p>

<p>The sparrow did as he was bid, and
perched on top of the post, close to Major’s
nose.</p>

<p>“A little while ago, while I was taking
my after-dinner nap,” began Major, “I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>heard voices, and I can tell you my ears
were wide open. I soon discovered that
the speakers were Mrs. Silverskin and a
friend of hers. Mrs. Silverskin said, ‘I am
all of a tremble, for I’ve just had an interview
with Graywhisker, and he insists on
my taking Hannah’s silver thimble and putting
it among Nancy’s things, to make them
think she stole it.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, what is there to tremble about?’
said the other mouse; ‘I don’t see anything
alarming in that.’</p>

<p>“‘Just think of the danger I run in
passing the house-cat,’ said Mrs. Silverskin;
‘she very nearly caught me the other day
when I stole the thimble.’</p>

<p>“‘She isn’t half so bad as the barn-cat,’
said the other mouse.</p>

<p>“‘I know she isn’t quite so quick, but
she’s too quick to suit me.’</p>

<p>“‘I wouldn’t go, then; tell Graywhisker
to go himself.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span></p>

<p>“‘Dear me! you don’t know him as well
as I do. I <i>must</i> go!’</p>

<p>“‘Well, then, why need you go through
the kitchen at all?’</p>

<p>“‘How in the world can I get into the
chamber without? I can’t climb up the side
of the house,’ said Mrs. Silverskin.</p>

<p>“‘Don’t you know the way through the
shed? You just go through the shed, and
up the stairs that lead to the loft above,
where they keep stores, and you’ll find a
little hole down at the right-hand corner
that leads into the chamber. I helped
gnaw it one night, and I know all about it.
I’ve bitten off pieces of Hannah’s tallow
candle more than once.’</p>

<p>“‘It’s a great relief to know that,’ said
Mrs. Silverskin; ‘thank you for the information.’”</p>

<p>“And I thank her for the information
too,” said the sparrow. “I can’t attend to
it myself,” he added, with an air of importance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
“because I’m a family man and don’t
like to be knocking around nights; but our
friend the house-cat will be on hand, I’ve
no doubt. The sooner I inform her of the
matter the better;” and he flew off in search
of the house-cat.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hat</span> night when Hannah was ready
to go to bed, the house-cat was nowhere
to be found. She didn’t like to go
to bed and lock her out, for she feared she
might come home during the night and
make a disturbance; and, moreover, she
didn’t fancy the thought of getting up after
she had gone to bed, to let her in.</p>

<p>Hannah went to the door and called, but
there was no answer; and after going about
the garden, calling “Puss, puss,” her patience
gave out and she went back to the
kitchen. “Stay out, then, if you want to;
you won’t catch me getting up to let you
in, if you yawl all night,” she said, as she
shut and bolted the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>The house-kittens might have given her
some information on the subject, if she
could have understood their language,&mdash;for
their mother had told them, early in
the evening, not to be alarmed if she were
out all night, as she had very important
business to attend to; but Hannah only
thought they were mewing for their mother,
when they tried to make her understand.
So Hannah went up to bed, where Nancy
was already sound asleep in her little cot-bed
and happily unconscious of the deep
plot laid for her by the evil-minded old rat.</p>

<p>“You look innocent enough,” said Hannah,
as her eyes fell on the sleeping child,
who was smiling in her sleep at some pleasant
dream; “but I don’t trust you,&mdash;appearances
are too suspicious.”</p>

<p>Soon Hannah too was fast asleep, and
the house silent.</p>

<p>Then, when everything was quiet, old
Graywhisker, with Hannah’s silver thimble
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>in his mouth, came softly out of his hole
and looked cautiously around to see if the
barn-cat were in sight. Not a sound was
to be heard, and he crept slyly along till he
came to a hole in the corner of the barn
farthest from the barn-cat’s nest; for he
didn’t dare trust the private entrance any
more, and had made this new exit with the
help of some of the younger rats.</p>

<p>When he found himself out of doors he
looked anxiously about. Yes, there was
Mrs. Silverskin, just where she had agreed
to be; and he went towards her.</p>

<p>“Here is the thimble, and mind you don’t
lose it!” he said, as he dropped it noiselessly
on the ground in front of the little mouse.
“Be sure you put it among Nancy’s things,
where Hannah will be likely to see it.”</p>

<p>“I will do my best,” said Mrs. Silverskin
softly.</p>

<p>“You are quite sure you understand the
way through the shed?” asked Graywhisker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“Quite sure,” answered the little mouse;
“I don’t see how I could possibly miss
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, all is quiet now, and the
sooner you are off the better.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Silverskin took up the thimble and
started on her expedition, and the old rat
returned to his hole to await her return.</p>

<p>When the little mouse came to the shed-door,
she stopped and looked cautiously
around. Not a sound was to be heard, and
she crept through a little hole under the
door and entered the shed. Everything
was very still,&mdash;not even a mouse was stirring
besides herself,&mdash;and she soon came
to the stairs that led to the loft above.</p>

<p>A ray of moonlight fell across the stairs,
and little Mrs. Silverskin stopped a minute
to rest and laid the silver thimble down. It
shone very prettily in the moonlight, and
she looked at it longingly.</p>

<p>“How my children would like it for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>plaything!” she said to herself; “it seems
a shame they can’t have it. It is too bad
to make them think that poor child is a
thief. She has a very good heart. I heard
them say she used to save crumbs for the
mice when she didn’t have enough to eat
herself. Posy, too,&mdash;she is such a dear
child, I hate to make her so unhappy. I
believe I will keep it for my babies, and
make old Graywhisker think I put it in
Nancy’s room. But then if he should ever
find out the truth it would be the end of
me; and he’d be sure to find it out, for he
knows everything. The barn-cat came near
getting him the other day,&mdash;I’m sure I
wish she had. Dear me! what was that
noise?”</p>

<p>Little Mrs. Silverskin trembled like a
leaf; but all was still again, and she concluded
it was only something that fell
down in the loft above. So, when she was
quite sure everything was quiet again, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>took up the thimble and went on very
cautiously.</p>

<p>She reached the head of the stairs and
found herself in the loft, and over there in
the corner was the hole just as her friend
had described it to her. “If I wasn’t sure
the house-cat was locked up in the kitchen,
I should think she was somewhere about,”
said little Mrs. Silverskin to herself, “for
I feel cold shivers down my spine just as
I always do when she or the barn-cat is
about; but I’m only nervous, I guess.”</p>

<p>So the little mouse went on her way, and
had nearly reached the hole, when suddenly
from behind a barrel darted the house-cat,
her large yellow eyes glaring fiercely in
the moonlight.</p>

<p>The poor little mouse gave a squeak of
terror, and dropping the silver thimble ran
swiftly for her life, closely followed by the
house-cat. One pause or misstep and all
would have been over with Mrs. Silverskin;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>and thinking of her babies at home who
were waiting for her, she ran as she never
ran before, dreading every moment to feel
the house-cat’s cruel claws; but she reached
the hole under the shed-door in safety, and
had just time to whisk her tail in after her
when the house-cat’s claws were at the
entrance.</p>

<p>How her little heart did beat when she
reached the barn; and how much faster
still it beat when she remembered that she
had left Hannah’s silver thimble behind,
and must give an account of herself to old
Graywhisker! Yes, there was the old rat
peering out of his hole, and she couldn’t
pass without his seeing her. His sharp old
eyes soon spied her out, and he called to
her to stop.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, eying her sharply as
she stood trembling before him, “how
did you get along? Come, don’t keep me
waiting here all night!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span></p>

<p>“I got along very well,” said the little
mouse, “until I reached the loft, and I was
almost up to the hole in the corner when
all at once out sprang the house-cat and
I had to run for dear life. I never had such
a narrow escape in my life.”</p>

<p>“And the thimble!” exclaimed the old rat
in a fierce tone; “where is the thimble?”</p>

<p>“I dropped it in my fright,” said the little
mouse in a shaking voice. “I couldn’t run
with it in my mouth; the house-cat would
surely have caught me if I had.”</p>

<p>“What!” squeaked the old rat. “You
lost the thimble, did you?” and he sprang
so suddenly at the poor little mouse that
she gave a loud squeal of terror,&mdash;so loud
that the barn-cat awoke from one of her
light cat-naps and quickly started up. As
she appeared, both Graywhisker and Mrs.
Silverskin ran.</p>

<p>“I believe I’m more afraid of Graywhisker
than I am even of the barn-cat,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>said the little mouse to herself, as she
reached her hole above the mow in safety.
“Dear me, what a fearful night this has
been! To be almost caught by the house-cat,
pounced on by Graywhisker, and then
chased by the barn-cat! Graywhisker is
certainly the worst of the three! What <i>will</i>
he do to me for losing the thimble? I
shan’t dare to stir out of my house till the
affair has blown over.”</p>

<p>The next morning the house-kittens were
busily playing.</p>

<p>“What has got into those kittens? They
act as if they were crazy,” said Hannah,
when she had nearly fallen over them for
the fifth time before breakfast. “Here,
you run out of doors and play there,” she
continued, driving them out; “I don’t care
to break my neck just yet!” So out the
kittens went, and the same performance was
gone through with there.</p>

<p>“What can those kittens have to play
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>with, do you suppose?” said Nancy, as the
children came in from the garden to breakfast;
“they are rolling something that
shines;” and they ran up to examine it
more closely.</p>

<p>“It is Hannah’s silver thimble, I do believe!”
exclaimed Tom, as he picked up
the shining plaything.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m so glad!” cried Nancy joyfully;
“now she won’t think I stole it.”</p>

<p>“I shall show it to her right off this very
minute,” said Posy, snatching the thimble
out of Tom’s hand and running into
the kitchen with it in a very earnest
manner.</p>

<p>“Hannah,” she said, holding up the thimble,
“here is your silver thimble,&mdash;the
house-kittens had it to play with, and Nancy
didn’t steal it, there now!”</p>

<p>Hannah put the thimble in her pocket
without a word; but this didn’t satisfy
Posy, who liked to see justice done, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>always felt distressed if people were not
harmonious in their relations to each other.</p>

<p>“<i>Now</i> you know her isn’t a thief, don’t
you, Hannah?” said Posy in her most
winning tones.</p>

<p>“I suppose she didn’t take the thimble,”
replied Hannah; “but the necklace and the
cat’s collar haven’t turned up yet.”</p>

<p>“Hannah!” cried Posy indignantly, “I
think you are a very mean girl, and I shan’t
ever come and help you cook any more!”</p>

<p>“Oh, do!” said Hannah, trying to look
very serious; “however shall I get along
with my cooking if you don’t help me?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Posy decidedly, “I shan’t
ever help you make cookies or anything
else; see if I do!”</p>

</div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> next morning Mr. and Mrs. Winton
were talking earnestly together in the
dining-room, and Mrs. Polly was listening
with all her might, for the conversation
turned on a subject that interested her
greatly. At a very important stage of the
conversation the door opened, and Posy
entered.</p>

<p>Mrs. Polly was greatly annoyed at the
interruption, and at once called “Posy,” in
a voice so like Tom’s that for a moment
Posy thought it really was Tom’s voice;
the second time Polly called, Posy detected
the deception.</p>

<p>“I know your voice, Mrs. Polly,” said
Posy, “you can’t fool me quite so easy;”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>and the large peanuts in Polly’s cage
looked so very inviting that she couldn’t
resist the temptation of fishing one out,
Mrs. Polly’s sharp eyes watching her fingers
and trying to give them a nip, although
she wouldn’t have had the heart to
hurt Posy in spite of her annoyance.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Posy?” asked
Mamma, who had stopped talking as soon
as the little girl appeared.</p>

<p>“Miss Pompadour is going to be married,”
said Posy, “and her wants a nice
handkerchief with pretty lace on it.”</p>

<p>Mamma agreed to let her have the handkerchief
provided she would return it, and
told Posy where she could find it; but
Posy still lingered, much to Mrs. Polly’s
vexation, for the interesting conversation
that Posy had interrupted would not be
resumed as long as she remained in the
room.</p>

<p>“Her wants a fan too,” said Posy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“A fan?” said Mamma. “Oh no, she
doesn’t need a fan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, her does,” persisted Posy, “her’s
to be married, you know, and her must
have a fan to blush on.”</p>

<p>“‘To blush on’?” asked Mamma. “Why,
what <i>do</i> you mean, Posy?”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you ’member ‘Jenny
blushed behind her fan’? Peoples always
does, Tom says.”</p>

<p>“If Tom says so it must be so,” said
Papa. “I think Mamma can let you have
a fan for such an important occasion,
Posy.”</p>

<p>“You are a dear, kind Papa,” said Posy,
hugging him; “and if you’ll give me a
dollar I’ll buy you such a <i>beautiful</i> birthday
present! I may as well tell you what it
is, for you’ll forget all about it before the
time comes.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me,” said Papa, “I like to be
surprised; but you shall have the dollar
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>when the time comes if you’ll run off now,
for Mamma has something to say to me.”</p>

<p>So off ran Posy for the handkerchief and
fan, and when they were alone again Mrs.
Winton continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“As I was telling you, you don’t know
how unhappy I feel about Nancy. Hannah
insists that she took Posy’s necklace&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Rats!” called out Polly in a loud tone,
“rats!”</p>

<p>“Be quiet, Polly,” said Mrs. Winton.&mdash;“I
don’t think it right to suspect the
child without proof; but I must say that it
looks very suspicious, and then, too, when
Posy missed the necklace she offered to run
back to the barn and look for it; but she
felt so badly when Hannah accused her,
that I pitied her and didn’t believe she
could have taken it.”</p>

<p>“Rats!” called Polly again.</p>

<p>“She doesn’t look like a dishonest child,”
said Mr. Winton; “but the poor thing has
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>been so neglected and abused that it
wouldn’t be strange if the temptation were
too great for her sometimes. We must
be on the lookout, for if she is really
dishonest this will not be the last of her
thefts.”</p>

<p>“The children are very fond of her, and
she certainly does seem devoted to them,
especially Posy. I must say it makes me
very uneasy to think my innocent children
may be influenced by her to do something
wrong.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it,” said Mr. Winton, “I
don’t believe she will injure either of them;
but I would watch her closely, and if you
have reason to suspect her again, investigate
the matter thoroughly, for the poor child
has never had any care and you may perhaps
be the means of saving her.”</p>

<p>“Then Hannah says,” resumed Mrs. Winton,
“that she misses a good deal from the
stores in the loft over the shed,&mdash;sugar and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>raisins and such things,&mdash;and she is sure
Nancy takes them.”</p>

<p>“Rats! rats!” screamed Mrs. Polly again,
so loudly that Mr. Winton exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p>“What a nuisance that bird is when she
screams so! I wonder if she does see a
rat! She sticks to it so persistently I
shouldn’t wonder;” and he rose and looked
out of the window. There were no signs
of rats there, however; the only living creatures
he saw were the little sparrows who
had a nest under the eaves of the piazza.</p>

<p>“Well, I must go,” he said, as he came
back from the window. “Major will think
that I have forgotten he is waiting harnessed;”
and soon Mrs. Polly and the
canary were the only occupants of the
dining-room.</p>

<p>“Provoking!” exclaimed Mrs. Polly. “I
do think human beings are the stupidest
things! Here I told them, as plainly as
could be, that the rats stole Posy’s necklace
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>and the sugar and raisins, and they couldn’t
understand! Talk about animals not being
as intelligent as human beings! Why can’t
they understand us as well as we can them,
I should like to know!”</p>

<p>“It does seem strange they didn’t know
what you meant,” said the canary; “I am
sure you spoke plainly enough.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand,” said Mrs. Polly in
an irritable tone, “how they can be so
stupid. Here they know that the rats steal
Major’s oats, and that it is the habit of rats
to steal anything that attracts their attention,
and yet it never occurs to them that
they are the ones that take the sugar and
raisins! If the barn-cat and the house-cat
were not so jealous of each other and didn’t
quarrel all the time, they might catch old
Graywhisker, for he is the one that makes
all the trouble; but no, they can’t work
together, and while one is at one end of
the hole, he slips out of the other. If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>they could only agree together for one to
watch at each end, they’d catch him fast
enough.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be trouble as long as he lives,”
sighed the canary. “Posy said Michael
was going to set a trap for him.”</p>

<p>“Much good that will do,” replied Mrs.
Polly scornfully; “he’s too old a head to
walk into a trap.”</p>

<p>All this time the barn-cat and the house-cat
had been devoting all their energies to
catching Graywhisker. It was very seldom
that either one or the other was not in the
way when he attempted to venture out;
and the barn-cat set the gray kitten and the
little tiger-kittens to watch when she could
not.</p>

<p>The gray kitten had grown stronger than
she was when she first came to live there,
and the young tiger-kittens considered themselves
a match even for Graywhisker. As
for poor little Mrs. Silverskin, she dared not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>venture out at all in these troubled times;
for, between her fear of Graywhisker and
the cats, times were hard indeed.</p>

<p>Old Graywhisker felt that his case was
becoming desperate. He sat in his house
and looked around on his once well-filled
larder. Not a crust, or rind of cheese or
pork, was left. His last crumb was gone,
and where was he to get more? It was
now several days since he had dared venture
out, and it was evident the cats were
bent on his destruction, for there was now
never a time when one of them was not
about. He knew he must make a bold
move and try to escape from the cats or
else die of starvation.</p>

<p>“You’ll never catch Graywhisker there,”
said the barn-cat to the house-cat, who was
watching the hole outside the barn. “He
comes out by half a dozen different ways.”</p>

<p>“Then why don’t you catch him yourself?
If you know so much better than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>anybody else, I should think it would
be easy enough,” retorted the house-cat
angrily.</p>

<p>“I intend to catch him,” replied the
barn-cat; “he’ll soon be starved out and
<i>have</i> to leave his hole.”</p>

<p>“And I intend to catch him too,” said the
house-cat.</p>

<p>“Between you both you’ll lose him,”
said the sparrow to himself, who, perched
on a pear-tree, had overheard the conversation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Graywhisker grew more and
more hungry. He searched his house over
and over again, hoping that he might have
overlooked a crust, but he could find nothing.
Then his eyes fell on the barn-cat’s collar,
and he gave the ugly grin that displayed
the broken front tooth so unpleasantly.
“If I can’t make you ornamental I can at
least make you useful, my dear Mrs. Barn-cat,”
he said. “Leather is not as much to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>my taste as pork or cheese or sugar, but it
is better than nothing; so here goes!” and
taking the pretty red collar between his
forepaws, he bit out a large piece. “Not
much flavor,” he continued; “but if you
think of a nice bit of toasted cheese or a
delicate piece of pork rind while it’s going
down, it isn’t so bad.”</p>

<p>Soon nothing remained of the gay little
collar that had been the barn-cat’s pride,
but the plate on which to engrave the
name and the padlock that used to tinkle
so musically; but after the leather was
eaten up, Graywhisker became desperate
indeed!</p>

<p>“If I could get hold of one of those
tiger-kittens, wouldn’t it be a treat?” he
exclaimed, with a horrible grimace. “I
<i>will</i> venture out, cost what it may. I don’t
know as it would be any worse to be
caught by the cats than to die here slowly
by inches. Oh, if I could only get hold
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>of one of those young rats or Mrs. Silverskin!
I’d make them bring me something
to eat,&mdash;they are so much lighter
than I am they can slip along more
easily.”</p>

<p>The barn-cat sat behind a post in the
barn, where she could hear and see without
being seen, and the house-cat was
watching a hole outside with great perseverance.</p>

<p>“He can’t come out without one of us
seeing him,” said the barn-cat to herself;
“I am sure of that. One thing is certain;
he can’t stand it much longer. He <i>must</i>
venture out soon for food, and then&mdash;”</p>

<p>Yes, she was right; he was coming out at
last,&mdash;that was his long gray nose looking
out of his hole, and those his small sharp
eyes. Hardly daring to breathe, the barn-cat
watched every motion. He looked
anxiously around in every direction, and
then stole softly along. The barn-cat did
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>not stir until he was directly opposite the
post where she was concealed, and then
gave a sudden spring, and her sharp claws
were fastened in his back, and the old thief
and plotter was a prisoner!</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">“C</span>ome</span> to the barn, the three of yees,
till ye see the big rat the barn-cat is
after catching,” said Michael to the children
the next morning; and off they started, in
such a hurry that poor little Posy tripped
over a stone and scraped the skin off her
chubby little hands.</p>

<p>“Be a brave girl and don’t cry,” said
Tom encouragingly, looking at Posy’s face,
that was distorted from the effort she made
to keep from crying.</p>

<p>“No,” said Posy, swallowing very hard
and winking back the tears; “I don’t cry
at trifles, do I, Tom? Some girls would
cry, wouldn’t they, Tom? The tears might
come into my eyes just a little bit, you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>know, but I wouldn’t cry;” and two great
tears rolled down Posy’s cheeks as she
spoke.</p>

<p>Nancy and Tom wiped the little hands
very tenderly, and Tom’s praise of her
fortitude made the smarting much easier
to bear; and in a few minutes the three
children were on their way to the barn
again.</p>

<p>On the barn-floor lay a large rat, gray
around the nose from age, and nearly as
large as the barn-cat herself, who sat
near by.</p>

<p>“He’s an old fellow,” said Michael; “ye
can see that by the gray beard of him.”</p>

<p>“Look at his long yellow teeth,” said
Tom, stooping to examine the rat more
closely, “and one of them is broken off.
I guess ’twas done in a fight, don’t you,
Michael?”</p>

<p>“It’s as like as not,” answered Michael.</p>

<p>“How pleased the cats seem to be!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>said Posy, looking from the barn-cat, who
watched the dead rat with so much satisfaction,
to the gray kitten, who looked on from
behind her, and the house-cat, who appeared
at the door and looked in with great interest.
The tiger-kittens came too, and
were so curious they couldn’t see all they
wanted to without going up to the rat and
smelling around him, till their mother gave
a little “meaw” and drove them back.
Then the house-kittens came too, and
peeped around the corner.</p>

<p>“I’m glad he’s out of the way, even if I
didn’t catch him myself,” said the house-cat.</p>

<p>The barn-cat was of too generous a
disposition to boast of her victory. “It
doesn’t make any difference who caught
him, now that he <i>is</i> caught. What I want
to see next is, these boards ripped up and
the old fellow’s nest examined; for I am
certain my collar and Posy’s necklace will
be found there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder they don’t think of it,” said
the house-cat; “but human beings are so
stupid I declare I’ve no patience with
them.”</p>

<p>“The cats mew just as if they were
talking it over,” said Tom.</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t wonder if they were,” said
Posy; “I wish we knew what they were
saying.”</p>

<p>“I wish you did,” said the house-cat,
“but that would be expecting too much
of you.”</p>

<p>The sparrow, too, had heard the news,
and perched on the window to get a look at
the notorious Graywhisker who had caused
so much mischief.</p>

<p>“I should have been in a pretty fix if
that old fellow had come home and found
me in his house that time,” he said to himself;
“one thing is certain, I shouldn’t be
sitting here now if he had. Hallo, my dear!
you came to get a sight of the old villain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>did you?” he said to the bright-eyed
sparrow who lit beside him.</p>

<p>“I do believe those sparrows have come
to see the rat too,” said Nancy.</p>

<p>Major, also, had turned around in his
box-stall and faced the little group assembled
around the dead rat, and appeared to
take great interest in the event.</p>

<p>“Now, the only thing left to do is to
tear up those boards and bring the old
fellow’s nest to light,” neighed Major.</p>

<p>“I guess Major is saying he’s glad the
old rat won’t be able to steal any more of
his oats, don’t you, Tom?” said Posy,
going up to the gentle horse and stroking
his soft nose.</p>

<p>“It’s more likely he’s after asking yees
for the apples ye have in the hands of
yees,” answered Michael.</p>

<p>Major gave him as scornful a look as his
mild eyes were capable of giving, and then
rubbed his nose affectionately against the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>little hand that stroked him, in order to
show his appreciation of the sympathy she
had with his feelings.</p>

<p>“Papa,” cried Tom and Posy together,
as Mr. Winton came out of the house, “do
come and see this awful big rat the barn-cat
caught last night.”</p>

<p>“He was an old stager, and no mistake,”
said Papa, looking at him. “I want you,
Michael, to take up these boards and destroy
all the old nests. I don’t doubt there
are a good many of them.”</p>

<p>The barn-cat was so delighted that she
completely forgot her dignity, and catching
sight of the tiger-kittens and house-kittens
at play in the yard, raced up to them and
chased them around till they thought she
had suddenly lost her wits.</p>

<p>“Well, I declare,” said the house-cat,
who was too well bred to forget <i>her</i> dignity
in such a manner, “I thought you had
a fit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“It did me good,” said the barn-cat;
“I had to do something or I should have
exploded with joy.”</p>

<p>That afternoon, Michael, armed with a
crowbar and hammer, went out to the
barn, followed by the children, who seated
themselves comfortably on the oat-box,
where they could obtain a good view of
Michael as he tore up the boards of the
floor.</p>

<p>Placing the crowbar under one of the
planks, he gradually pried it up and laid it
on one side. The children peeped curiously
in, but to their great disappointment nothing
was to be seen.</p>

<p>“It’s here where they’ve been,” said
Michael; “I see the tracks of ’em.”</p>

<p>Then another plank was pried up and
laid aside, and Michael looked down and
carefully examined the ground. “It’s here
where the old villain lived, I’ll be bound,”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>Down jumped the children from the oat-box
and stood beside Michael.</p>

<p>“There’s his nest,” cried Tom excitedly,&mdash;“that
bunch of rags and twine in the corner.”</p>

<p>“It’s right ye are,” replied Michael.</p>

<p>“What’s that yellow thing there under
that rag?” asked Tom.</p>

<p>Michael stooped and picked up the object
that had attracted Tom’s attention.</p>

<p>“My amber necklace,” shrieked Posy
joyfully. “Oh, I’m so glad! Now they
won’t say you took it any more, Nancy;”
and snatching the necklace from Michael’s
hand, she darted out of the barn, calling
“Mamma” so loudly that Mrs. Winton was
at the door almost as soon as Posy was.</p>

<p>“My amber necklace,” cried Posy, waving
it frantically over her head. “It was in
the old rat’s nest. Come and see where he
lived.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Winton followed Posy to the barn,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>and looked into what had once been Graywhisker’s
home.</p>

<p>“It was right there, under that old rag,”
cried Tom; “I saw it first.”</p>

<p>“What is that little thing shining there?”
asked Mrs. Winton, pointing to a bright
spot.</p>

<p>Michael picked it up and handed it to
her.</p>

<p>“Why, it must be the padlock to the
barn-cat’s collar!” exclaimed Mrs. Winton.
“What a thief the old fellow was! I know
now where the sugar and raisins must have
gone. Tell Hannah to come here a minute,
Tom.”</p>

<p>Tom was off like a shot and soon returned,
bringing Hannah, who looked greatly
astonished at the unusual message.</p>

<p>“Hannah,” said Mrs. Winton, holding up
the amber necklace, “Posy’s necklace has
been found in this old rat-hole, and also
what is left of the barn-cat’s collar. You
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>see your suspicions were unfounded. The
thief who has caused so much mischief is
now dead, and I think you will find that
your stores in the loft will not disappear as
fast as they used to.”</p>

<p>Hannah was silent, and her face flushed.</p>

<p>“You do believe, <i>now</i>, that Nancy isn’t
a thief, don’t you, Hannah?” said Posy
earnestly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Hannah slowly, for it cost
her a great effort to acknowledge she had
made a mistake; “I see I was mistaken,
and I am sorry. I can’t say no more than
that, as I know.”</p>

<p>“Hannah,” said Posy, with her sweetest
smile, “I <i>don’t</i> think you are a mean girl,
and I <i>will</i> help you cook whenever you
want me to.”</p>

<p>“Then I’m all right,” answered Hannah
cheerfully.</p>

<p>It would be hard to tell how happy Nancy
was at the favorable turn affairs had taken;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>and if such a thing were possible, the animals,
who had been the means of bringing
it to pass, were even happier than she was.
Mrs. Polly was so excited that for several
days she talked the family almost to death,
and the canary sang till it seemed as if his
little throat would burst.</p>

<p>The sparrow settled down into quite a
model husband and father, and very seldom
relapsed into his old habits. He and the
little bright-eyed sparrow continued to be
very fond of each other, and brought up
many broods of young sparrows,&mdash;some of
them lively young fellows like their father
and as fond of keeping late hours as he used
to be, and others as bright-eyed and domestic
as the bright-eyed sparrow herself.</p>

<p>The barn-cat and the house-cat continued
to disagree in their ideas of education, but
their kittens associated together with great
amiability and did not share the jealousies
of their mothers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span></p>

<p>Little Nancy never left the kind friends
who had befriended her, and was so devoted
to Posy and made her so happy that a new
nurse never appeared, and the children became
more attached to her every day, if
such a thing were possible.</p>

<p>The story represents the action of certain animals, the characters of
depicted in accordance with their natures and the exigencies of the story. The object
is to cultivate the love of animal nature, which most children feel, and especially
for such creatures as bats, toads and others, which children are often improperly taught
to regard with disgust. The human characters introduced talk and act naturally, and
this book will be found very entertaining to young people.</p>

<p class="no-indent"><b>Jolly Good Times To-Day.</b> With illustrations by
<span class="smcap">Jessie McDermott</span>. 16mo. Cloth. Price, $1.25.</p>

<p>A sensible book, and it is sensible because it is merry and natural.&mdash;<i>New York
Times.</i></p>

<p>A complete description of the happy every-day life of American children of the
present day.&mdash;<i>Christian Register.</i></p>

<p>Natural, every-day children.&mdash;<i>Churchman.</i></p>

<p>One of the jolliest, most natural, and readable books we have read for many a
day.&mdash;<i>Boston Times.</i></p>

<p>A most charming book for children, whose scene is laid in our very midst, is
Mrs. Mary P. Wells Smith’s “Jolly Good Times To-Day.” The writer, Mrs.
Fayette Smith, of Avondale, has been very successful in her books for young people
but this is the first instance where she has drawn upon her own beautiful neighborhood
for materials. Apart from the interest felt in a description of people in our
midst, the book is charming in its fresh, simple presentation of child-life. Mrs.
Smith has the power of entering directly into the personality of her characters, and,
as a result, they are real people. The book is full of local references that will interest
Cincinnatians, and this fact, with its excellence as a story, should make it very popular
with our young folk.&mdash;<i>Cincinnati Tribune.</i></p>

<p>The book is rightly named, and is the fifth in a series of volumes bearing similar
title. It is brimming from cover to cover with healthy, hearty, child’s companionship
and wholesomely jolly times. It is the story of children whose lives are put in
pleasant places, where the modern possessions of our day contribute freely to the
general happiness; where the comradeship of elders gives no undue sense of parental
authority, but, rather, a friendly sharing of mutual guiding; where liberal instincts and
thoughtful living create an atmosphere of growth and of personal privilege, wherein
young lives may unconsciously expand toward a noble future.&mdash;<i>Unity.</i></p>

<p>“Jolly Good Times To-Day,” by Mary P. Wells Smith, is a very pretty and
natural story of child-life. The author evidently understands children, and sympathizes
with them in their joys and griefs. She knows, too, how to entertain them in a
bright, sensible way.&mdash;<i>Christian Intelligencer.</i></p>

<p>The “Voyage of the Liberdade” reads like a romance, but is, nevertheless, the
faithful account of a marvellous experience in the career of that indomitable Yankee
tar&mdash;Capt. Joshua Slocum. How the wonderful little boat, containing the author and
his family, made a journey of 5,000 miles in the face of perils calculated to terrify
many of the hardiest is told without any attempt at rhetorical garnish, yet with a
clearness that gives it a permanent literary value.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
